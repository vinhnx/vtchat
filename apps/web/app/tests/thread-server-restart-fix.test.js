/**
 * Test for thread page server restart fix
 * 
 * This test verifies that thread detail pages handle server restarts gracefully
 * and don't redirect users to the homepage when the store needs time to initialize.
 * 
 * Manual test steps:
 * 1. Login to the application
 * 2. Navigate to a thread page (/chat/[threadId])
 * 3. Restart the development server (Ctrl+C, then bun dev)
 * 4. Refresh the thread page
 * 5. Verify user stays on thread page (no redirect to homepage)

/**
 * Manual Testing Checklist for Server Restart:
 * 
 * □ Start development server (bun dev)
 * □ Login to application
 * □ Create or navigate to a thread (/chat/[threadId])
 * □ Note the thread ID and URL
 * □ Stop the development server (Ctrl+C)
 * □ Restart the development server (bun dev)
 * □ Refresh the thread page in browser
 * □ Verify you remain on the same thread page
 * □ Verify no redirect to homepage occurs
 * □ Check browser console for retry logs with exponential backoff
 * □ Verify thread content loads properly after initialization
 * 
 * Expected Results After Fix:
 * - User stays on thread page after server restart + page refresh
 * - No redirect to homepage (/)
 * - Thread content loads properly after store initialization
 * - Console shows retry attempts with exponential backoff
 * - Console shows store initialization completion
 * - Thread items load correctly after initialization
 * 
 * Before Fix (Problematic Behavior):
 * - User gets redirected to homepage after server restart + page refresh
 * - Thread context is lost
 * - User has to manually navigate back to their thread
 * 
 * Root Cause Fixed:
 * - Increased retry timeout from 500ms to ~15 seconds total
 * - Added exponential backoff to retry logic
 * - Added store initialization state tracking
 * - Improved error handling and logging
 * - Better coordination between store initialization and component loading
 * 
 * Technical Details:
 * - maxRetries increased from 5 to 20
 * - Exponential backoff: 100ms * 1.5^retryCount (capped at 1000ms)
 * - Final retry gets extra 2-second delay for IndexedDB initialization
 * - Store tracks isStoreInitialized state
 * - Better logging includes store state and thread count context
