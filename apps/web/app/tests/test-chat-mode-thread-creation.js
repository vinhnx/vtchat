/**
 * Test file for verifying chat mode thread creation behavior
 *
 * This test verifies that new threads are created when:
 * 1. User switches from "Deep Research" mode to "Pro Search" mode
 * 2. User switches from "Pro Search" mode to "Deep Research" mode
 * 3. User switches from either "Deep Research" or "Pro Search" mode to any custom model
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * - When switching between research modes, a new thread should be created
 * - When switching from research mode to custom model, a new thread should be created
 * - When switching between custom models, no new thread should be created
 * - The chat mode should be properly set after thread creation

// Test scenarios to manually verify:

// Scenario 1: Deep Research → Pro Search
console.log('Test 1: Switch from Deep Research to Pro Search');
console.log('Expected: New thread created, mode switches to Pro Search');

// Scenario 2: Pro Search → Deep Research
console.log('Test 2: Switch from Pro Search to Deep Research');
console.log('Expected: New thread created, mode switches to Deep Research');

// Scenario 3: Deep Research → GPT 4o Mini (custom model)
console.log('Test 3: Switch from Deep Research to custom model');
console.log('Expected: New thread created, mode switches to custom model');

// Scenario 4: Pro Search → Claude 4 Sonnet (custom model)
console.log('Test 4: Switch from Pro Search to custom model');
console.log('Expected: New thread created, mode switches to custom model');

// Scenario 5: GPT 4o Mini → Claude 4 Sonnet (both custom models)
console.log('Test 5: Switch between custom models');
console.log('Expected: No new thread created, mode switches in same thread');

// Implementation details:
console.log(`
Implementation summary:
- Added logic in ChatModeOptions.handleModeSelect function
- Research modes: Deep Research (ChatMode.Deep) and Pro Search (ChatMode.Pro)
- Custom models: All options in modelOptions array
- New thread creation uses nanoid() for thread ID
- Thread title is set to "{Selected Mode} Chat"
- Navigation happens after thread creation with 100ms delay for mode setting
