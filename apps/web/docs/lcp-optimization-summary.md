# LCP Optimization Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Performance Optimizations Component

- Added preload directives for critical images:
    - `/icon-192x192.png` (VT logo)
    - `/icons/peerlist_badge.svg` (LCP element identified in Lighthouse)
    - `/favicon.ico` (site favicon)
- Added font preloading for Google Fonts

### 2. Thread Component Optimization

- Implemented skeleton loading for initial render
- Added `fetchPriority="high"` and `decoding="async"` attributes to critical images
- Reduced initial load time by showing immediate visual feedback

### 3. Next.js Configuration

- Added HTTP Link headers for resource preloading
- Enabled CSS optimization in experimental features

## Expected Impact

These optimizations should improve LCP by:

1. **Reducing resource load times** through preloading of critical assets
2. **Eliminating render-blocking delays** by showing skeleton UI during initial load
3. **Prioritizing critical asset loading** with appropriate HTML attributes
4. **Improving cache efficiency** with optimized headers

## Verification Plan

1. Run Lighthouse performance tests to verify LCP improvement
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
3. Check that no regressions were introduced in other performance metrics
4. Verify that all preload directives are working correctly

## Files Modified

1. `apps/web/components/performance-optimizations.tsx`
2. `packages/common/components/thread/thread-combo.tsx`
3. `apps/web/next.config.mjs`
4. `apps/web/app/tests/lcp-optimization.test.ts` (new test file)

## Next Steps

1. Run performance tests to verify improvements
2. Monitor real-user performance metrics
3. Consider additional optimizations like image compression and code splitting
4. Implement service worker caching for critical assets
