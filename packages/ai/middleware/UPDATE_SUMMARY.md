# AI SDK v4 Middleware Guide Update Summary

## Overview

We've updated the middleware documentation to align with AI SDK v4 and VT Chat's implementation. The previous guide was based on AI SDK v5, which has different interfaces and patterns.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Created a new comprehensive guide** (`GUIDE.md`) that documents:
   - Proper usage of `wrapLanguageModel` function
   - Correct middleware interface types for AI SDK v4
   - Updated examples using `LanguageModelV2Middleware`
   - Detailed implementation patterns for different middleware types

2. **Updated existing documentation** to reference the new guide:
   - Modified `README.md` to link to the comprehensive guide
   - Updated `SUMMARY.md` and `FINAL_SUMMARY.md` to include the new guide file

3. **Maintained compatibility** with existing implementation:
   - Kept the existing middleware implementations using `LanguageModelV2Middleware`
   - Preserved the AI SDK v4 `wrapLanguageModel` integration using `LanguageModelV1Middleware`
   - Verified that all tests continue to pass

## Technical Details

### Interface Alignment
- **AI SDK v4**: Uses `LanguageModelV1Middleware` for `wrapLanguageModel`
- **VT Chat Implementation**: Uses `LanguageModelV2Middleware` for actual middleware implementations
- **Compatibility**: Both interfaces are compatible and work together correctly

### Updated Examples
All examples in the new guide have been updated to:
- Use correct type imports from `@ai-sdk/provider`
- Show proper implementation patterns for AI SDK v4
- Include VT Chat's enhanced configuration system
- Demonstrate combining multiple middleware sources

### Configuration System
The guide now documents VT Chat's advanced middleware configuration:
- Flexible enable/disable system
- Presets for common use cases (DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, PERFORMANCE, PRIVACY)
- Support for custom middleware combinations

## Verification

All existing tests continue to pass, confirming that:
- Middleware implementations work correctly
- Integration with `wrapLanguageModel` functions properly
- Configuration system operates as expected
- No breaking changes were introduced

This update ensures our documentation accurately reflects the current implementation and provides a comprehensive guide for developers working with language model middleware in AI SDK v4.
