/**
 * OpenRouter Integration Tests
 *
 * These tests verify OpenRouter integration with actual API calls (when API key is available)
 * and ensure that the provider sends authentic requests to OpenRouter endpoints.
 *
 * Requirements tested:
 * - 2.3: OpenRouter responds with actual model response content
 * - 2.4: OpenRouter requests are sent to correct endpoints with proper authentication
