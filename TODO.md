# TODO List

[] Customer portal:

or calling:
const redirectUrl = await axios.post(
  `https://{host}/v1/customers/billing`,
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_xxxxxxx",
    },
    {
      headers: { "x-api-key": `creem_123456789` },
    },
);

NOTE:

1. where {host} is: make sure `https://test-api.creem.io/v1/customers/billing` is for creem.io sandbox and `https://api.creem.io/v1/customers/billin` is production
1. `customer_id` value in request body is the current `creem_customer_id` or `stripe_customer_id` id in `user_subscriptions` table from neon postgresql db
1. `x-api-key` in headers is get from `CREEM_API_KEY` in .env file
1. handle `manage subscription` logic in packages/common/hooks/use-payment-subscription.ts -> fetch above api and handle url response -> open that api to view

--
check db

1. creem_customer_id in users table
1. stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id in user_subscriptions table -> rename colum to remove `strip_` -> replace with `creem_`
1. unify creem_customer_id in users table and newly renamed creem_customer_id, creem_subscription_id in user_subscriptions table
1. update apps/web/lib/database/schema.ts and apps/web/migration_better_auth.sql, do migration
1. you can use drizzle orm, context7, neon, better-auth, creem.io MCP tools to make db schema and migration on db
--

1. wow! <https://tailark.com/>

--

1. now review #codebase and draft a plan, make sure subscription logic works across the app from payment -> subscription store -> db call on neon db sync -> sync app plan instantly and
1. should call on app start or page refresh: /api/subscription/status should be call once and update to db, only refresh after payment callback or sub expired, Or every page refresh
1. IMPORTANT: make sure to handle this logic per account and check non-login
1. check for GatedFeatureAlert entrypoint calling #codebase and check sub status
1. unify subscription logic and use one unidufy sub use in #editFiles and
1. update schema and migration if  needed
note: you can use context7, neon, better-auth, creem.io MCP tools
--

1. migrate useVtPlusAccess and use useSubscriptionStatus
1. make sure unify subscription logic as once and remove redundant logic make sure sync with neon db and web hook from creem.io payment call back
1. you can use context7, neon, better-auth, creem.io MCP tools

--

1. optimize /api/subscription/status should be call once and update to db, only refresh after payment callback or sub expired
1. IMPORTANT: make sure to handle this logic per account and check non-login
you can use MCP tools like neon context7 creem.io
--

1. rename Usage Credits in settings modal to `Plan` -> also update card components on Usage Credits settings modal to HoverCard components with dark/light mode proper typography and color. better UI on the Plan tab

--

How to verify Creem signature on webhook objects.
â€‹
How to verify Creem signature?

Creem signature is sent in the creem-signature header of the webhook request. The signature is generated using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm with the webhook secret as the key, and the request payload as the message.
Copy

{
'creem-signature': 'dd7bdd2cf1f6bac6e171c6c508c157b7cd3cc1fd196394277fb59ba0bdd9b87b'
}

To verify the signature, you need to generate the signature using the same algorithm and compare it with the signature sent in the header. If the two signatures match, the request is authentic.

You can find your webhook secret on the Developers>Webhook page.

To generate the signature, you can use the following code snippet:
Copy

import * as crypto from 'crypto';

  generateSignature(payload: string, secret: string): string {
    const computedSignature = crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', secret)
      .update(payload)
      .digest('hex');
    return computedSignature;
  }

In the code snippet above, the payload is the request body, and the secret is the webhook secret. Simply compare the generated Signature with the one received on the header to complete the verification process.
