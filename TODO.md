The concept was revolutionary for our marketplace\u2014users could simply point their camera at an item, and our AI would automatically generate a high-quality listing with extracted product information, category mapping, and pricing suggestions.\\n\\nThe initial architecture involved several key components:\\n- **Real-time camera feed processing** using AVFoundation (Apple\'s multimedia framework)\\n- **Multimodal data extraction** (text, audio, video, image)\\n- **Hybrid intelligence model** combining on-device and cloud AI\\n- **Probabilistic UI design** to handle non-deterministic AI responses\\n\\n### Phase 2: Research and Dataset Preparation\\n\\nOur Data team undertook the massive task of collecting and labeling datasets specifically for this project:\\n- **52 categories** across VEH ^& GDS (Vehicles ^& General Goods)\\n- **4,632 videos** total (100 videos per category)\\n- **Strict quality guidelines** to ensure AI-generated content met platform standards\\n\\nThis dataset became the foundation for training our AI models to accurately extract attributes and map products to Ch\u1ee3 T\u1ed1t\'s specific category taxonomy.\\n\\n## Technical Challenges and Solutions\\n\\n### Challenge 1: Transitioning from Deterministic to Probabilistic Programming\\n\\n**The Problem:**\\nTraditional mobile app development follows predictable patterns: fetch data from an API, decode it into a strict model, display it in a defined UI. LLM programming shattered this paradigm entirely.\\n\\n**The Solution:**\\nWe developed a flexible data ingestion layer that could handle:\\n- Variable AI outputs with optional fields\\n- Unexpected response formats\\n- Partial or incomplete data\\n- Resilient parsing mechanisms\\n\\nInstead of \\"fail-fast\\" decoding, we embraced graceful degradation and suggestion-based interfaces.\\n\\n### Challenge 2: Real-time Multimodal Data Processing\\n\\n**The Problem:**\\nUnlike our previous straightforward use of AVFoundation for video playback, Rapid Listing demanded a sophisticated real-time data extraction pipeline. At Ch\u1ee3 T\u1ed1t, we have a dedicated Video Hub section where users can upload and share videos related to their listings, enhancing the overall user experience and engagement on the platform. We leveraged this existing engineering knowledge and expertise to build the Rapid Listing feature, applying advanced real-time video processing to connect with our AI services while ensuring a seamless user experience.\\n\\nWe needed to:\\n- Process CMSampleBuffer streams directly from the camera\\n- Extract high-quality frames without blocking the main thread\\n- Synchronize video, audio, and image data streams\\n- Intelligently select relevant frames to minimize costs and latency\\n\\n**The Solution:**\\nWe architected a multi-tiered processing system:\\n\\n`\\n1. Client-side intelligent filtering\\n   \u2193\\n2. Multimodal data synchronization\\n   \u2193\\n3. Optimized payload creation for backend LLM\\n`\\n\\n### Challenge 3: Hybrid Intelligence Architecture\\n\\nRather than relying solely on server-side AI (which would create poor UX with loading spinners), we implemented a hybrid model:\\n\\n**Tier 1: On-Device Intelligence (TensorFlow Lite)**\\n- Real-time object detection and user guidance\\n- Product category mapping\\n- Local feedback enhancement\\n- ~26ms inference time on 224x224 image crops\\n\\n**Tier 2: Remote LLM for Deep Inference**\\n- Complex attribute extraction\\n- Advanced category mapping\\n- Price estimation and validation\\n- Quality assurance against platform guidelines\\n\\n## System Architecture Diagrams\\n\\n### System Architecture Breakdown\\n\\n#### 1.

We optimized our video processing pipeline to handle:\\n- Continuous frame extraction from camera streams\\n- Intelligent frame selection algorithms\\n- Memory-efficient processing to prevent device overheating\\n- Seamless integration with AI inference services\\n\\n### UI/UX for Probabilistic Systems\\nThe non-deterministic nature of LLM responses forced us to completely rethink our UI approach:\\n- **Traditional approach:** Fixed data model \u2192 Rigid interface\\n- **AI-first approach:** Variable data \u2192 Adaptive, suggestion-based UI\\n\\nWe designed the interface to present AI-generated listings as pre-filled, editable drafts, managing user expectations while inviting review and refinement.\\n\\n### Integration Challenges\\nCoordinating between on-device ML models, real-time camera processing, and remote LLM services required careful optimization:\\n- **Threading management** to prevent UI blocking\\n- **Memory optimization** for ML model efficiency\\n- **Network resilience** for remote AI calls\\n- **Error handling** for probabilistic systems\\n\\n## Project Management: Agile in an AI World\\n\\nWe adopted Kanban methodology to manage the inherent uncertainty of R^&D and AI development. This approach proved essential for:\\n- **Cross-team coordination** between Mobile, Data/AI, Product, and Design teams\\n- **Iterative development** with rapid prototyping and testing\\n- **Stakeholder alignment** across multiple workgroups\\n- **Risk management** in uncertain AI development timelines\\n\\nThe collaborative nature was crucial\u2014this wasn\'t just a mobile project, but a full company initiative involving Marketplace Foundation, Platform Engineering, Data, AI, Product, and Product Design teams.\\n\\n## The Evolution: From Garage Sale to Rapid Listing\\n\\nThe project\'s name evolution from \\"Garage Sale\\" to \\"Rapid Listing\\" reflected our growing understanding of the product\'s true potential. What began as a simple concept for selling items quickly became a sophisticated AI-powered listing generation tool that could transform how users interact with marketplace platforms.\\n\\n## Results and Impact\\n\\nThe successful launch of \\"\u0110\u0103ng nhanh b\u1eb1ng AI\\" marked several important milestones:\\n\\n### Technical Achievements\\n- Successfully integrated real-time multimodal AI processing on mobile devices\\n- Achieved sub-30ms on-device inference times\\n- Built resilient probabilistic data handling systems\\n- Created adaptive UI for non-deterministic AI responses\\n\\n### Product Impact\\n- Dramatically reduced listing creation time for users\\n- Improved listing quality through AI-powered suggestions\\n- Enhanced user engagement through interactive camera-based interface\\n- Established Ch\u1ee3 T\u1ed1t as an AI-forward marketplace platform\\n\\n### Key Features Delivered\\n- **Real-time camera feed processing** with immediate user feedback\\n- **Multimodal AI integration** (text, audio, video, image)\\n- **Intelligent product detection** with category suggestions\\n- **Automated attribute extraction** from visual and audio cues\\n- **Quality assurance** aligned with platform guidelines\\n\\n## Technical Specifications\\n\\n### On-Device Intelligence Stack\\n- **Framework:** TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment\\n- **Model Size:** Optimized for mobile deployment\\n- **Inference Time:** ~26ms for 224x224 image processing\\n- **Capabilities:** Object detection, category guidance, user feedback enhancement\\n\\n### Multimodal Processing Pipeline\\n- **Video Processing:** AVFoundation with real-time frame extraction\\n- **Audio Processing:** Synchronized audio capture and segmentation\\n- **Image Processing:** High-quality frame selection and optimization\\n- **Data Synchronization:** Coherent multimodal payload creation\\n\\n### Remote AI Integration\\n- **Architecture:** Hybrid cloud-device intelligence\\n- **Optimization:** Response time and accuracy improvements\\n- **Quality Assurance:** Adherence to platform review guidelines\\n- **Scalability:** Designed for marketplace-scale traffic\\n\\n## Feature Availability and Guidelines\\n\\n**\u0110\u0103ng nhanh b\u1eb1ng AI** (Rapid Listing with AI) helps sellers create listings more easily and conveniently with AI assistance.

Greetings,

As a bug bounty hunter and web security researcher, my main objective is to protect the internet from cyberattacks. I specialize in identifying and reporting bugs on websites, providing comprehensive vulnerability assessment reports that detail the identified issues. During my recent research efforts, I came across your website, vtchat.io.vn.

Vulnerability: Missing DMARC Record

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol designed to help domain owners protect their domains from unauthorized use, specifically email spoofing. Its implementation aims to defend against business email compromise attacks, phishing emails, email scams, and other cyber threats. A DMARC record includes a policy that determines how unauthenticated or forged emails should be handled. The absence of this record creates an opportunity for attackers to exploit the domain name. On your website, I discovered a similar issue where anyone can send emails from your domain (hello@vtchat.io.vn) to other users.

Proof of Concept:

By using the following DMARC record, I successfully sent a manipulated email to my own address, making it appear as if it originated from your contact form on hello@vtchat.io.vn.

Screenshot Proof-of-Concept attached.

Impact:

This phishing technique can be highly effective, allowing attackers to send forged emails from your domain and impersonate your company's official representatives. They can manipulate victims into providing sensitive information, including money or credentials. Extensive research studies highlight the critical importance of implementing DMARC and SPF protocols to mitigate such risks.

Fix:

To address this issue, I recommend implementing a DMARC record for your domain. This will help prevent unauthorized use of your domain for email spoofing. If you need further assistance or have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out. I'm here to help.

I would also like to mention that I am looking forward to the possibility of a bug bounty reward for this responsible disclosure. Once this matter is addressed and resolved, I hope to report any additional bugs that I may come across.

Thank you and regards,
Ivanna
