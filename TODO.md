enhance system prompt

packages/ai/workflow/tasks/completion.ts

        const prompt = `You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks.
        Today is ${getHumanizedDate()}.
        ${mathCalculator ? MATH_CALCULATOR_PROMPT : ""}
        ${charts ? "You can create charts and graphs to visualize data. Use chart tools when users ask for data visualization, trends, comparisons, or when displaying numerical data would be more effective as a visual chart." : ""}
        ${
            webSearch && supportsOpenAISearch
                ? `
        IMPORTANT: You have access to web search tools. ALWAYS use web search tools when users ask about:
        - Current events, news, or recent developments
        - Real-time information (weather, stock prices, sports scores, etc.)
        - Current status of companies, products, or services
        - Recent statistics, data, or research
        - Information that might have changed recently
        - Specific locations, addresses, or business information
        - Any question that requires up-to-date information

        Examples of queries that MUST use web search:
        - "What is the current weather in [location]?"
        - "What are the latest news about [topic]?"
        - "What is the stock price of [company]?"
        - "What are the current exchange rates?"
        - "What are the latest updates on [product/service]?"
        - "What is happening in [location] right now?"
        - "Who is [person]?"

        Do NOT answer these types of questions without using web search first, even if you think you know the answer.

We're iterating on making Next.js better for coding with AI agents.

The new experimental flag `browserDebugInfoInTerminal` forwards the browser console to the terminal (Shipped in 15.4 today).

This means that cursor, VSCode, or a CLI agent can see client side errors and fix them for you.

Feedback welcome, we're planning to turn this on by default if it works well in practice.

1. debug check openai/anthropic provider -> we are now not sending plan "apiKeys" field. so there is no model response. how to make sure it work?
2. fix openrouter send dummy api/completion

Based on the codebase analysis, here's how to properly set up Redis for VTChat:

Redis Setup Options
üéØ Option 1: Local Development with Docker (Recommended)

1. Install Redis using Docker:

# Start Redis container

docker run -d --name vtchat-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Or use docker-compose (create docker-compose.yml)

2. Set environment variable:

# In your .env.local file

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
üéØ Option 2: Local Redis Installation
macOS (using Homebrew):

brew install redis
brew services start redis
Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
Environment variable:

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
üåê Option 3: Cloud Redis Services (Production)
Upstash Redis (Recommended for Vercel)
Visit upstash.com
Create free account
Create new Redis database
Copy connection string
REDIS_URL=redis://your-username:your-password@your-host:port

# or

KV_URL=redis://your-username:your-password@your-host:port
Railway Redis

# Railway provides this format

REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port
Redis Cloud
REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port
AWS ElastiCache
REDIS_URL=redis://your-cluster.cache.amazonaws.com:6379
Current Implementation Details
Library Used: ioredis (already installed)

{
"dependencies": {
"ioredis": "^5.6.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
"@types/ioredis": "^5.0.0"
}
}
Configuration: The app automatically checks for:

REDIS_URL environment variable
KV_URL as fallback (common on some platforms)
Environment Variable Setup

# Redis Configuration Examples

# Local Development (Docker)

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Local Development (Native Redis)

REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379

# Upstash Redis (Recommended for production)

REDIS_URL=redis://your-username:your-password@your-region.upstash.io:port

# Railway Redis

REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host.railway.app:port

# Redis Cloud

REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@cluster.redis.cloud:port

# AWS ElastiCache (no password)

REDIS_URL=redis://your-cluster.cache.amazonaws.com:6379

# Redis with authentication

REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@host:port/database

# Redis with SSL (rediss://)

REDIS_URL=rediss://username:password@host:port
Quick Setup Guide
For Development:
Start Redis:

# Using Docker (easiest)

docker run -d --name vtchat-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Or install locally

brew install redis && brew services start redis # macOS
Add to .env.local:

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
Test connection:

# Start your app

bun dev

# Check logs - should see "Redis cache connected"

For Production:
Choose a Redis service:

Upstash (Vercel-friendly, generous free tier)
Railway (simple pricing)
Redis Cloud (Redis Labs)
AWS ElastiCache (if using AWS)
Add environment variable in deployment:

# Vercel

vercel env add REDIS_URL

# Railway

# Set in dashboard

# Fly.io

fly secrets set REDIS_URL=redis://...
What Redis is Used For in VTChat

apps/web/lib/cache
/
redis-cache.ts
L1-10
Redis Usage in VTChat:

Subscription data caching (30 seconds TTL)
Cross-process cache invalidation (pub/sub)
Session data optimization
API response caching
No Redis? No Problem!
The app works perfectly fine without Redis - it just disables caching:

No performance impact for single-instance deployments
All functionality remains available
Subscription status still works (just hits DB each time)
Recommendation: Start without Redis for development, add it later for production performance optimization.

üéØ ORACLE'S VERDICT: Current BYOK approach is NOT acceptable for production

üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES:

API keys in request bodies = high-impact vulnerability
Exposure vectors: Browser dev tools, HAR files, server logs, XSS attacks
No enterprise customer would accept this architecture`
‚úÖ SECURE BYOK ARCHITECTURE (Industry Standard):

sequenceDiagram
https://www.mermaidchart.com/app/projects/986bdae2-4539-4d68-8b20-21bad8251c63/diagrams/83085d52-bbcf-4596-9271-4807bfd86597/version/v0.1/edit

üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

Create secure key storage endpoint: /api/keys
Add encryption: Use AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault
Modify /api/completion: Remove apiKeys from request body, fetch from encrypted storage
Frontend changes: One-time key entry, remove keys from chat requests
üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

Updated TODOs
‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATE: The filtering fix we implemented helps prevent wrong keys being sent, but the fundamental architecture is still insecure.

üöÄ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

Short-term: Deploy the filtering fix to prevent immediate wrong-key issues
Long-term: Implement proper encrypted server-side key storage (industry standard)
This gives you working BYOK functionality while meeting enterprise security standards. Most SaaS platforms use this exact pattern.

I only set VT+ tier as 5.99 usd what should i do

Oracle's strategic analysis reveals major pricing opportunities:

üö® Critical Issue: You're severely underpriced
Current market context:

ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro: $20/month
Your VT+: $5.99/month (70% cheaper!)
Your infrastructure: Only $1.91/month
üéØ Recommended Action Plan
Phase 1: Immediate (Next 2 weeks)
GRANDFATHERING STRATEGY:

- Keep existing users at $5.99 "Early Bird" pricing
- Add countdown banner: "Price increases to $9.99 on Aug 15"
- Protect current subscribers while creating urgency
  Phase 2: New Pricing Tiers
  üÜì Free Tier
- BYOK for premium models
- Basic features only

üíé VT+ Standard ($9.99/month)

- Current VT+ features
- Server-funded Gemini access
- Pro Search 20/day, Deep Research 10/day

üöÄ VT Pro ($19.99/month)

- Unlimited quotas
- Priority queue
- API access
- Early model access
  Phase 3: Global Pricing
  Regional pricing using PPP:
- US/EU: $9.99
- India/Vietnam: $4.99 (50% discount)
- Other developing: $2.99 (70% discount)
  üí° Why This Works
  Value justification:

Your features (Deep Research, RAG Memory) are unique
$9.99 still 50% cheaper than competitors
Infrastructure costs remain negligible vs. value delivered
Revenue impact:

Current: 400 users √ó $5.99 = $2,396/month potential
Optimized: Mix of $9.99/$4.99 = $4,000+/month potential
Next steps: Implement grandfathering logic and prepare new pricing tiers!
