# Launch Plan

https://chatgpt.com/c/6862c1f9-8aa8-8003-a651-414083759701

Below is a concise review of your launch materials against established best practices for each channel (Hacker News, Twitter, Product Hunt, Peerlist). Key recommendations and citations are provided to help you sharpen titles, tone, formatting, and engagement strategies.

## Summary

Your drafts are technically rich and precise, which aligns well with developer audiences. To maximize traction, tighten headlines to avoid marketing‐speak, foreground unique value propositions in hooks, and ensure each post’s formatting follows platform conventions. Below are channel-specific tweaks.

---

## 1. Hacker News – Show HN

### What’s Working

* **Technical depth**: Clear bullets on BYOK, model support, IndexedDB isolation.
* **Transparency**: Open-source links and live URL immediately visible.

### Tune-Ups

1. **Title clarity & brevity**

   * Drop adjectives like “privacy-first” in title; focus on “what it is” not “feel” ([lucasfcosta.com][1]).
   * **Suggested**:

     ```
     Show HN: VT Chat – AI chat in browser with BYOK and IndexedDB isolation
     ```

2. **Minimize marketing-speak**

   * Remove phrases like “– Privacy-first AI chat with BYOK, 23 models…”; HN users prefer factual, code-centric titles ([news.ycombinator.com][2], [indiehackers.com][3]).

3. **Link directly to repo/demo**

   * Link README or live demo in the first paragraph to reduce barriers to trial ([lucasfcosta.com][1]).

4. **Concise post body**

   * Trim business-model section; HN discussions rarely dwell on pricing.
   * Move “Business model” to a comment reply instead of the main post.

---

## 2. Twitter Thread Series

### What’s Working

* Comprehensive feature bullets; clear tier distinctions.

### Tune-Ups

1. **Hook & thread notation**

   * Start Tweet 1 with a hook plus “(1/3)” or a thread emoji ([podia.com][4]).
   * **Example**:

     > “1/3 Thrilled to launch VT Chat: AI chat in your browser 🔐 (full thread)”

2. **One idea per tweet**

   * Ensure each tweet stands alone for quote-retweets ([tweethunter.io][5]).
   * E.g., split “20+ models + BYOK” into two tweets if needed.

3. **Storytelling & pacing**

   * Frame Tweet 2 as benefit-driven (“Never worry about rate-limits…”), Tweet 3 as technical deep-dive ([socialwick.com][6]).

4. **Call-to-action & visuals**

   * End thread with “Try it → [https://vtchat.io.vn”](https://vtchat.io.vn”) and include a screenshot GIF ([content-whale.com][7]).

---

## 3. Product Hunt Launch

### What’s Working

* Strong feature list; clear free vs. paid tiers.

### Tune-Ups

1. **Tagline brevity**

   * Keep under 10 words; focus on “what it does” not “why” ([arounda.agency][8]).
   * **Suggested**:

     > “AI chat in browser with your own API keys”

2. **Early posting & global timing**

   * Schedule for 12:01 AM PST on July 1 to maximize 24-hr exposure ([demandcurve.com][9]).
   * Then coordinate social/email at 8 AM ET (19:00 GMT+7).

3. **Thumbnail & assets**

   * Use a 240×240 px GIF showcasing chat UI; static logos underperform ([demandcurve.com][9]).

4. **First comment as story**

VT began as a weekend experiment and evolved into a year-long journey, taking many forms along the way.

I’ve learned so much from open-source projects, generous write-ups, and builders sharing in public.

Try VT Chat today at https://vtchat.io.vn
The app is fully open source at https://github.com/vinhnx/vtchat

   * Under the PH listing, add a comment outlining your “why” and invite feedback ([zeda.io][10]).

---

## 4. Peerlist.io & Microlaunch.net

### What’s Working

* Detailed technical stack; clear use cases.

### Tune-Ups

1. **Concise title + category**

   * Use “VT Chat: In-browser AI chat with BYOK” under “Developer Tools / AI” to improve discoverability.
2. **Bullet readability**

   * Limit bullets to 5–6 key differentiators; group related items (models, security, storage).
3. **Call-to-action**

   * End descriptions with “Try it free → vtchat.io.vn” or “GitHub → link”.

---

**Implementing these refinements** will align your materials with each platform’s norms, reduce friction for technical audiences, and spotlight your unique architecture. Let me know if you’d like sample rewrites or further tuning on any section.

Based on my thorough codebase analysis, here are the **FINAL ACCURATE** launch materials:

## 1. Hacker News - Show HN (Final Version)
Title: Show HN: VT Chat – AI chat in browser with BYOK & per-account IndexedDB isolation.

Post:
I’ve spent the last year building VT Chat, an AI chat app that runs 100% in your browser. All data—API keys, conversation history, per-account IndexedDB.

* Live demo: https://vtchat.io.vn
* Code & docs: https://github.com/vinhnx/vtchat
* Twitter: https://twitter.com/vtdotai
* My Twitter: https://twitter.com/vinhnx
* Product Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com/products/vt?launch=vt

**Key technical highlights**
- **BYOK for six providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Fireworks, xAI, OpenRouter—store your API keys locally and bypass shared‑service rate limits.
- **23 models supported**: GPT‑4o, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek R1, Grok 3, o3/o3‑mini, Qwen 3 14B, Flash Lite, etc.
- **Per-account isolation**: ThreadDatabase_{userId} instances in IndexedDB enforce strict data separation on shared machines.
- **Advanced reasoning mode**: Step‑by‑step “AI thinking” trace for compatible models (Claude, GPT‑4o).
- **Document & web integration**: Upload PDF/DOC/TXT/MD, run semantic search; invoke real‑time web search; generate interactive charts in‑app.
- **Zero‑trust architecture**: Local storage only, complete logout wipes all data and keys.

**Tech stack & infra**
- Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Framer Motion
- Auth: Better Auth (GitHub, Google, Twitter OAuth)
- Backend: Neon PostgreSQL, Arcjet security, Turborepo monorepo, Turbopack (87% faster builds)
- Deployment: Fly.io, Bun runtime

I’m eager for feedback on the architecture, performance trade‑offs, and any edge cases I might have missed. Thanks!

# Hacker News
I'm putting the finishing touches on VT[0] - a minimal AI chat client focused on privacy. No tracking, clean interface, with support for deep research, web search grounding, tool calls, and RAG.

The code is all open source on GitHub[1]. Really close to shipping now - hope to share launch details soon.

These monthly HN threads have been great motivation for me to keep building consistently. Thanks everyone!
