Search the codebase to understand existing subscription management. Draft a comprehensive plan and scheme for implementing a full 'VT+' subscription management flow. Add actionable items to my TODO list.

**Product Details for VT+:**

* **Name:** VT+
* **Product ID:** Use environment variable `CREEM_PRODUCT_ID`. Do not hardcode `prod_1XIVxekQ92QfjjOqbDVQk6`.
* **Description:** "For everyday productivity"
* **Payment:** Subscription type, 9.99 USD monthly, price includes tax.
* **Features:**
    1. **Pro Search:** "Pro Search: Enhanced search with web integration for real-time information."
    2. **Dark Mode:** "Access to dark mode."
    3. **Deep Research:** "Deep Research: Comprehensive analysis of complex topics with in-depth exploration."

**Implementation Plan & Scheme Requirements:**

1. **Environment Handling:**
    * Implement logic to distinguish between development (sandbox API keys, test customer IDs) and production (live API keys, live customer management).
    * Consult the Creem.io webhook guide for development environment setup: `https://docs.creem.io/learn/webhooks/introduction#2-register-your-development-webhook-endpoint`.

2. **Core Subscription Logic (Creem.io SDK):**
    * Implement subscription logic using the Creem.io SDK. Ensure subscription status is correctly checked and updated.
    * Upon user purchase:
        * Update internal subscription logic and storage.
        * Review the codebase for previous subscription logic. Update or migrate from any existing systems (e.g., Zustand storage and schema) as needed.
    * Sync subscription status to Neon database, associating it with the user ID.

3. **Feature Gating & UI Updates:**
    * Activate the gated `dark_theme` feature for 'VT+' subscribers and manage its subscription benefit accordingly.
    * Update the tier plan display in "Settings > Usage Credits": Show a `user-tier-badge` component for 'VT+' subscribers instead of the current "FREE" text.
    * Modify the "View Plans" button behavior on the sidebar:
        * If subscribed to 'VT+': Redirect to the user's Creem.io customer portal. (Refer to Creem.io customer portal documentation: `https://docs.creem.io/learn/customers/customer-portal`, example: `https://www.creem.io/test/my-orders/JDJhJDE1JHhTMzUvcU1nRFJhYnV3anVhSFVpTmU`).
        * If not subscribed: Maintain current "View Plans" functionality.

**Tooling & Notes:**

* Utilize Context7 MCP tools or other MCP tools if necessary.
* Focus on creating robust code that handles API errors and edge cases.

Generate the plan, scheme, and TODO list. For TODO items, suggest relevant files/modules if identifiable from your codebase search

can you implement account-based thread managements system with neon and postgres using out existing thread schema and store logic. review #codebase for clues.

Note

1. make sure thread is per account.
1. you can use Neon MCP to make schema and db migration.
