I only set VT+ tier as 5.99 usd what should i do

Oracle's strategic analysis reveals major pricing opportunities:

ðŸš¨ Critical Issue: You're severely underpriced
Current market context:

ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Perplexity Pro: $20/month
Your VT+: $5.99/month (70% cheaper!)
Your infrastructure: Only $1.91/month
ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Action Plan
Phase 1: Immediate (Next 2 weeks)
GRANDFATHERING STRATEGY:
- Keep existing users at $5.99 "Early Bird" pricing
- Add countdown banner: "Price increases to $9.99 on Aug 15"
- Protect current subscribers while creating urgency
Phase 2: New Pricing Tiers
ðŸ†“ Free Tier
- BYOK for premium models
- Basic features only

ðŸ’Ž VT+ Standard ($9.99/month)
- Current VT+ features
- Server-funded Gemini access
- Pro Search 20/day, Deep Research 10/day

ðŸš€ VT Pro ($19.99/month)
- Unlimited quotas
- Priority queue
- API access
- Early model access
Phase 3: Global Pricing
Regional pricing using PPP:
- US/EU: $9.99
- India/Vietnam: $4.99 (50% discount)
- Other developing: $2.99 (70% discount)
ðŸ’¡ Why This Works
Value justification:

Your features (Deep Research, RAG Memory) are unique
$9.99 still 50% cheaper than competitors
Infrastructure costs remain negligible vs. value delivered
Revenue impact:

Current: 400 users Ã— $5.99 = $2,396/month potential
Optimized: Mix of $9.99/$4.99 = $4,000+/month potential
Next steps: Implement grandfathering logic and prepare new pricing tiers!
