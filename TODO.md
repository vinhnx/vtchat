# Hacker News
I'm putting the finishing touches on VT[0] - a minimal AI chat client focused on privacy. No tracking, clean interface, with support for deep research, web search grounding, tool calls, and RAG.

The code is all open source on GitHub[1]. Really close to shipping now - hope to share launch details soon.

These monthly HN threads have been great motivation for me to keep building consistently. Thanks everyone!
