# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Gemini image generation capabilities to VT, allowing users to generate images using Google's Imagen models through the AI SDK. The implementation will integrate with the existing AI provider system and provide a seamless image generation experience within the chat interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VT user, I want to generate images using Gemini's Imagen models, so that I can create visual content directly within the chat interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a valid Google API key configured THEN the system SHALL display Gemini image generation models in the model selector
2. WHEN a user selects a Gemini image model THEN the system SHALL enable image generation mode in the chat interface
3. WHEN a user submits a text prompt with an image model selected THEN the system SHALL generate an image using the Gemini Imagen API
4. WHEN image generation is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated image in the chat conversation
5. WHEN image generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a VT user, I want to see available Gemini image models in the model selector, so that I can choose the appropriate model for my image generation needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the model selector THEN the system SHALL display available Gemini image models (imagen-3.0-generate-001, imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001)
2. WHEN a user hovers over an image model THEN the system SHALL display model information including capabilities and limitations
3. WHEN no Google API key is configured THEN the system SHALL show image models as disabled with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN a Google API key is configured but invalid THEN the system SHALL indicate the key needs to be updated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a VT user, I want the image generation to work seamlessly with the existing chat interface, so that I can generate images without disrupting my conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image model is selected THEN the chat input SHALL adapt to show image generation specific UI elements
2. WHEN switching between text and image models THEN the system SHALL preserve the current conversation context
3. WHEN an image is generated THEN the system SHALL add it to the conversation history with appropriate metadata
4. WHEN viewing conversation history THEN generated images SHALL be displayed with their original prompts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a VT user, I want proper error handling for image generation, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with instructions to configure the key
2. WHEN the prompt violates content policies THEN the system SHALL display the policy violation message from the API
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display a rate limit message with retry information
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display a generic error message with retry option
5. WHEN quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display quota information and billing link

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a VT user, I want image generation to respect my privacy settings, so that my generated images are handled according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN privacy mode is enabled THEN generated images SHALL be stored only locally in IndexedDB
2. WHEN images are generated THEN no image data SHALL be sent to VT servers for storage
3. WHEN clearing conversation history THEN generated images SHALL be removed from local storage
4. WHEN exporting conversations THEN users SHALL have the option to include or exclude generated images
