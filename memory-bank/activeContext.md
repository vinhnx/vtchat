# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on completing UI enhancements and ensuring consistency across components.

## Recent Changes

- Updated gitchamber.com usage instructions in agent guide files
- Added models.dev API usage instructions to agent guides and removed models-data.json file

- **Mobile Floating Menu Visibility Fix - COMPLETE âœ…**:
  - Ensured floating menu buttons remain visible on mobile by limiting `rounded-sm` and `overflow-hidden` to desktop screens
  - Files: `packages/common/components/layout/root.tsx`

- **Chat Input Button Selection Logic - COMPLETE âœ…**:
  - **Issue Resolved**: Implemented comprehensive button selection logic to ensure only one button and only one mode is selected at a time
  - **Key Features**:
    - Only one button can be active at any given time (webSearch, mathCalculator, structuredOutput)
    - When a user selects a button, it becomes active and all other buttons are deactivated
    - Chat mode selection also clears all other button states
    - Buttons can be toggled on/off by clicking them again
    - State is properly persisted to localStorage
    - All button states are reset when changing chat modes
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `packages/common/store/chat.store.ts` - Enhanced `setActiveButton` and `setChatMode` functions
    - `packages/common/components/chat-input/__tests__/button-selection.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Updated `setActiveButton` function to handle mutual exclusion between buttons
    - Modified `setChatMode` to reset all button states when chat mode changes
    - Added localStorage persistence for button states
    - Ensured proper state management with immediate UI updates
  - **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite with 7 test cases covering all button selection scenarios
  - **Result**: Users can now only have one input mode active at a time, providing a clear and consistent UX

- **Auth Client 404 Error Fix - COMPLETE âœ…**:
  - **Issue Resolved**: Fixed 404 error on `/api/auth/fetch-options/method/to-upper-case` caused by incorrect auth client configuration
  - **Root Cause**: The `createAuthClient` from better-auth was receiving invalid `fetchOptions` configuration with `timeout` and `onError` properties that don't belong in the client config
  - **Solution**: Removed `fetchOptions` from the auth client configuration as these are server-side only options
  - **Files Modified**: `packages/shared/lib/auth-client.ts`
  - **Additional Fix**: Updated parameter structure for `getSession` calls to use proper better-auth API format with `query` wrapper
  - **Result**: Auth client now correctly communicates with server endpoints without malformed URLs

- **React Fragment Error Fix - COMPLETE âœ…**:
  - **Issue Resolved**: Fixed React console error "Invalid prop `onClick` supplied to `React.Fragment`"
  - **Root Cause**: `GatedFeatureAlert` component was trying to clone React Fragment children and add `onClick` props
  - **Solution**: Removed unnecessary `<div>` wrapper in `image-upload.tsx` when passing children to `GatedFeatureAlert`
  - **Files Modified**: `packages/common/components/chat-input/image-upload.tsx`
  - **Result**: Clean console output with no React Fragment prop errors

  - Tested the fix successfully - database connections now handle errors gracefully and provide user-friendly error messages

- **User Button Functional Grouping Enhancement:** Improved the user popover by connecting the Settings menu item to the actual settings modal:
  - Connected the "Settings" item in the user dropdown to open the settings modal using `setIsSettingsOpen(true)`
  - Maintained the existing functional grouping structure:
    - **Account Management:** Settings (now functional), Profile
    - **Support & Legal:** Help Center, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy
    - **Sign Out:** Logout action
  - Added proper integration between user button and settings modal for better UX

- **Sidebar Blocking Indicator Fix:** Resolved the issue where a full-page loader blocked the sidebar during logout:
  - Replaced `FullPageLoader` with a non-blocking empty state message when no threads are present
  - Sidebar remains functional during logout process and thread clearing
  - Improved user experience by preventing interface blocking during authentication state changes
  - Removed unused `FullPageLoader` import to clean up linting warnings

- **Sidebar User Dropdown Functional Grouping:** Added proper functional grouping to the sidebar's user dropdown menu:

- **Example Prompts - Complete Content Refresh & Revamp:** Updated `packages/common/components/example-prompts.tsx`:
  - **Styling:**
    - Applied category-specific colors to icons within the example prompt buttons.
    - Changed button variant to `outlined` for consistency with `shadcn/ui`.
    - Removed `rounded="full"` for default `shadcn/ui` button rounding.
    - Added a hover ring effect for better visual feedback.
  - **Content:**
    - All example prompts across all categories (`howTo`, `explainConcepts`, `creative`, `advice`, `analysis`) have been completely replaced with new, fresh, and current topics. Each category has been expanded to contain 7 prompts.
    - The new prompts focus on recent developments, AI, technology trends, and contemporary societal questions, offering a wider variety of starting points for users. One prompt was specifically updated to "Explain how Large Language Models work."
- **`TODO.md` Cleanup and Refinement:** Organized and categorized tasks in `TODO.md` for better clarity and actionability. Removed non-actionable items and notes better suited for other documentation.
- **Dynamic CTA Buttons on Plus Page:** Updated `apps/web/app/plus/page.tsx` to make the Call to Action (CTA) buttons more dynamic:
  - The "Free" plan button now shows "Continue" (and links to `/chat`) if the user is signed in and on the free tier.
  - The main CTA button at the bottom of the page and the button on the VT+ plan card now display "Manage Subscription" along with the `UserTierBadge` if the user is currently subscribed to VT+. They correctly trigger `openCustomerPortal`.
- **Plus Page Subscription Button Update (Initial):** Modified `apps/web/app/plus/page.tsx` to include the `UserTierBadge` within the "Manage Subscription" button when a user has an active VT+ subscription.
- **Refined Subscription Error Handling with Toasts:** Further refined the error handling in `packages/common/hooks/use-payment-subscription.ts` within the `startVtPlusSubscription` function. Instead of throwing an error when `response.ok` is false (e.g., user already subscribed), the code now directly calls `toast` with the error message and sets the local error state. The `catch` block was also updated to provide more specific toast notifications for other types of errors during the checkout process.
- **Subscription Error Toast (Initial Implementation):** Modified `packages/common/hooks/use-payment-subscription.ts` to use `useToast` to display an error message when the `/api/checkout` endpoint returns an error. This addresses the console error "Error: You already have an active VT+ subscription. Use the customer portal to manage your subscription." by showing it to the user in a toast.
- **Dark Theme Gating Implemented:**
  - Modified `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` to set `defaultTheme="light"` and `enableSystem={false}`. This ensures the application defaults to light theme, and the operating system's theme preference does not override this for non-subscribed users. The existing `ModeToggle` component already handles gating the manual toggle to dark theme for subscribed users.
- **`intro-dialog` Component Removed:**
  - Removed the usage of `IntroDialog` from `packages/common/components/layout/root.tsx`.
  - Removed the export of `IntroDialog` from `packages/common/components/index.ts`.
  - Deleted the component file `packages/common/components/intro-dialog.tsx`.
  - Resolved a coincidental TypeScript error by removing an erroneous export for `client-root.tsx` from `packages/common/components/index.ts`.
- Completed removal of credit system components and logic.
- Updated payment system to focus exclusively on VT+ subscriptions.
- Verified all credit-related files were already removed.

- **Arcjet Security Removal - COMPLETE âœ…**:
  - **Issue Resolved**: Successfully completed full removal of Arcjet from the codebase as requested
  - **Actions Taken**:
    - Deleted duplicate protected route file: `apps/web/app/api/auth/[...better-auth]/route.protected.ts`
    - Removed all Arcjet references from documentation files (`SECURITY.md`, `llms.txt`)
    - Deleted Arcjet memory bank documentation: `memory-bank/arcjet-security-integration.md`
    - Confirmed no remaining Arcjet packages or imports in the codebase
    - Verified build passes successfully without any Arcjet-related errors
  - **Result**: Arcjet has been completely removed from the codebase with no remaining references or dependencies

- **Mobile PWA Installation Notification - COMPLETE âœ…**:
  - **Issue Resolved**: Added Sonner toast notification for mobile users to guide them on installing the VT app as a PWA
  - **Implementation Details**:
    - Created `useMobilePWANotification` hook that detects mobile devices and shows a one-time notification
    - Notification appears only on mobile devices (screen width < 768px) using existing `useIsMobile` hook

    - Included step-by-step instructions: "1. Look for the ðŸ“¤ Share button in your browser toolbar"
    - Added directional guidance: "â†“ Share button is usually in the browser menu or toolbar"
    - Extended toast duration to 12 seconds to give users more time to read the detailed instructions
    - Maintained the existing "Got it" action button and auto-dismiss functionality
    - Used emoji and visual cues to make the instructions more intuitive and user-friendly
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `packages/common/hooks/use-mobile-pwa-notification.ts` - Enhanced toast content with visual share button guidance
    - `TODO.md` - Marked PWA notification task as completed
  - **User Experience**:
    - Clear visual representation of the share button users need to find
    - Step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow
    - Longer display time allows users to properly read and understand the instructions

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The current theme implementation relies on `next-themes` and its localStorage persistence for user-selected themes (for subscribed users).

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Memory Bank First:** Always read and update Memory Bank files as per `USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS`.
- **Iterative Approach:** Tackle tasks group by group, and item by item within each group.
- **Clear Communication:** Document changes and decisions in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project structure involves a monorepo with `apps/web` for the Next.js application and `packages/` for shared code.
- `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` is configured in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`.
- Component exports are managed in `packages/common/components/index.ts`.
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest is now the primary testing framework with comprehensive monorepo support and modern developer experience.
