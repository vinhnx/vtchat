# Streaming RSC Payload Fix - Completion Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved critical "Failed to fetch RSC payload" errors affecting admin panel and chat functionality by implementing streaming compatibility fixes for Next.js 15 + Turbopack environment.

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Issue

- **Error**: "Failed to fetch RSC payload for http://localhost:3000/chat/..."
- **Secondary Error**: "controller[kState].transformAlgorithm is not a function"
- **Impact**: Complete failure of admin page and chat functionality
- **Root Cause**: Incompatibility between ky HTTP client's JSON parsing and Next.js 15 Turbopack streaming architecture

### Technical Context

- Next.js 15.4.5 with Turbopack experimental features
- ky HTTP client v1.8.2 with centralized wrapper
- React Server Components (RSC) payload system
- AbortController signal handling conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced HTTP Client (packages/shared/lib/http-client.ts)

```typescript
/**
 * POST request that returns raw Response for streaming endpoints.
 * Use this for endpoints that return streaming responses instead of JSON
 */
postStream: ((url: string, options: SecureRequestOptions = {}): Promise<Response> => {
    const { apiKeys = {}, body, ...kyOptions } = options;
    const client = Object.keys(apiKeys).length > 0 ? createSecureClient(apiKeys) : baseClient;

    const requestOptions: KyOptions = {
        ...kyOptions,
        ...(body && { json: body }),
    };

    // Return the raw Response for streaming
    return client.post(url, requestOptions);
});
```

### 2. Updated Agent Provider (packages/common/hooks/agent-provider.tsx)

```typescript
// Changed from http.post to http.postStream for streaming compatibility
const response = await http.postStream('/api/completion', {
    body,
    signal: abortController.signal,
});
```

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Type Casting

```typescript
// Fixed event type casting for compile-time safety
eventType as (typeof EVENT_TYPES)[number];
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Build Success

- Clean build with no errors
- All TypeScript compilation successful
- Turbo caching working properly

### ✅ Runtime Stability

- Development server starting cleanly
- No RSC payload errors
- No transformAlgorithm errors
- Admin page accessible
- Chat functionality operational

### ✅ Code Quality

- 5 files formatted automatically
- Linting errors confined to test files only
- No critical production code issues

## Technical Benefits

### Performance

- Raw Response objects avoid unnecessary JSON parsing overhead
- Streaming compatibility maintains performance characteristics
- AbortController signals properly handled

### Architecture

- Centralized HTTP client maintains security patterns
- Clear separation between JSON and streaming endpoints
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing endpoints

### Reliability

- Eliminates RSC payload fetch failures
- Resolves AbortController signal conflicts
- Maintains proper error handling patterns

## Files Modified

1. **packages/shared/lib/http-client.ts**
   - Added `postStream` method for raw Response streaming
   - Maintains security patterns with API key handling

2. **packages/common/hooks/agent-provider.tsx**
   - Updated to use `postStream` for `/api/completion` endpoint
   - Fixed TypeScript event type casting

3. **apps/web/lib/admin.ts**
   - Enhanced error handling with structured logging

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- [x] Verify admin panel functionality
- [x] Test chat streaming responses
- [x] Monitor for any remaining RSC errors

### Future Considerations

- Monitor streaming performance in production
- Consider extending `postStream` pattern to other streaming endpoints
- Evaluate Next.js 15 Turbopack stability for production deployment

## Lessons Learned

1. **Next.js 15 + Turbopack Streaming**: Requires special handling for endpoints that return ReadableStream responses
2. **HTTP Client Design**: Separation of JSON and streaming endpoints improves compatibility
3. **AbortController Signals**: Next.js 15 streaming architecture requires careful signal handling
4. **RSC Payload System**: Sensitive to HTTP response processing methods

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All critical functionality restored:

- ✅ Admin panel operational
- ✅ Chat functionality working
- ✅ No RSC payload errors
- ✅ Clean build and runtime
- ✅ Streaming compatibility achieved
