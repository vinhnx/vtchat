# Oracle Consultation Workflow Reminder

## Date: 2025-01-07

## Requirement

**ALWAYS** consult Oracle before implementing any new task. This is a required step in the development workflow.

## Updated Workflow

1. **Task Intake**: Write Problem Statement, goals, acceptance criteria
2. **ASK-ORACLE (PLAN)**: Provide context and ask for detailed implementation plan
3. **Implementation**: Implement strictly according to Oracle's plan
4. **REVIEW-ORACLE**: Present diff/PR for review and approval
5. **Merge & Document**: Only after Oracle approval

## Key Points

- No exceptions for regular development tasks
- Oracle must approve before merging
- Document Oracle plan + approval in memory-bank
- Use enumerated questions for Oracle consultation
- Keep Oracle context relevant and concise

## Integration with Todo Workflow

- Always add "Consult Oracle for implementation plan" as first todo
- Mark Oracle consultation as completed before implementation
- Add Oracle review as final todo before completion
