# Change Planning Workflow Reminder

## Date: 2025-01-07

## Requirement

Always write a plan and request maintainer feedback before implementing any significant task.

## Updated Workflow

1. **Task Intake**: Write Problem Statement, goals, acceptance criteria
2. **PLAN**: Provide context and draft a detailed implementation plan
3. **Implementation**: Implement according to the agreed plan
4. **Review**: Present diff/PR for review and approval
5. **Merge & Document**: Only after approval

## Key Points

- No exceptions for regular development tasks
- Request approval before merging
- Document plan + approval in memory-bank
- Keep context relevant and concise

## Integration with Todo Workflow

- Always add "Draft implementation plan" as first todo
- Mark plan review as completed before implementation
- Add plan review as final todo before completion
