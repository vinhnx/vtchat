**Impact**: Enterprise-grade application security layer added to VTChat

## üìã Implementation Summary

### Core Integration Achieved

VTChat now features comprehensive application security through Arcjet integration, providing multi-layered protection against modern web threats while maintaining optimal user experience.

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### **1. Centralized Security Configuration**

- Created `packages/shared/lib/arcjet-config.ts` with reusable security configurations
- Implemented specialized configurations for different use cases (chat, auth, API, feedback)
- Added type-safe configuration options with full TypeScript support

#### **2. Enhanced Better Auth Integration**

- Advanced user-specific rate limiting using authenticated user IDs
- Intelligent fallback to IP-based limiting for unauthenticated users

- **15 tests** for Better Auth + Arcjet integration (`better-auth-arcjet.test.ts`)
- **100% pass rate** across all security test scenarios
- Coverage of configuration, decision handling, route matching, error scenarios

#### **Manual Testing Procedures**

```bash
# Rate limiting verification
curl -X POST /api/auth/sign-up -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'

# Bot detection testing
curl -I /api/feedback

# Email validation testing
curl -X POST /api/auth/sign-up -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"disposable@temp-mail.org","password":"test123"}'
```
