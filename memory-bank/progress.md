# Progress Log

## Completed Tasks

### Customer Portal Window Integration (Latest) ✅

**Date:** December 14, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & PRODUCTION READY

- ✅ **Refactored to Window-Based Approach**: Completely removed modal, inline, and separate page approaches due to X-Frame-Options restrictions
- ✅ **Window Opening Logic**: Portal opens in new window/tab using window.open() with proper security settings
- ✅ **Enhanced useCreemSubscription Hook**: Added portalUrl management and window-based opening logic
- ✅ **Removed All Inline/Modal Code**: Deleted InlinePortal component, CustomerPortalModal, and portal page
- ✅ **Updated All UI Components**: UsageCreditsSettings, Sidebar, Plus page all use openCustomerPortal()
- ✅ **Return Handling**: Added `/api/portal/return` route to handle return navigation from portal
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Subscription status refreshes when portal window is closed using window messaging and close detection
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Toast notifications inform users when portal opens in new window
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: All portal-related state and logic centralized in useCreemSubscription hook
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety and no compilation errors

**Result:** Customer portal opens in new window/tab due to Creem.io's X-Frame-Options security policy. Users can manage subscriptions and are automatically returned to the app with refreshed subscription status.
