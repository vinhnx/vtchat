# Progress Log

## Completed Tasks

### `TODO.md` Cleanup and Refinement ✅

**Date:** June 14, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ **Reviewed and Categorized:** All items in `TODO.md` were reviewed.
- ✅ **Standardized Format:** Tasks were organized into logical categories (e.g., Authentication, UI/UX, Dependencies).
- ✅ **Removed Non-Actionable Items:** Links for pure research or notes not representing a direct task were moved to a "Research & Exploration" section or noted for potential migration to other documents.
- ✅ **Improved Clarity:** The `TODO.md` is now more structured, making it easier to identify and prioritize pending work.
- ✅ **Omitted Informational Blocks:** Sections like the "VT+ subscription product description" were noted as better suited for `productContext.md` or dedicated specs and were not included in the refactored `TODO.md`.

**Result:** `TODO.md` is now a cleaner, more organized, and actionable list of pending tasks.

### Customer Portal Tab Integration (Latest) ✅

**Date:** December 14, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & PRODUCTION READY

- ✅ **Refactored to Tab-Based Approach**: Completely removed modal, inline, and separate page approaches due to X-Frame-Options restrictions
- ✅ **Tab Opening Logic**: Portal opens in new tab using `window.open(url, '_blank')` for better user experience
- ✅ **Enhanced useCreemSubscription Hook**: Added portalUrl management and tab-based opening logic
- ✅ **Removed All Inline/Modal Code**: Deleted InlinePortal component, CustomerPortalModal, and portal page
- ✅ **Updated All UI Components**: UsageCreditsSettings, Sidebar, Plus page all use openCustomerPortal()
- ✅ **Return Handling**: Added `/api/portal/return` route to handle return navigation from portal
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Subscription status refreshes when portal tab is closed using window messaging and close detection
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Toast notifications inform users when portal opens in new tab
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: All portal-related state and logic centralized in useCreemSubscription hook
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety and no compilation errors
- ✅ **Updated Terminology**: All comments, logs, and UI text refer to "tab" instead of "window" for consistency

**Result:** Customer portal opens in new tab due to Creem.io's X-Frame-Options security policy. Users can manage subscriptions and are automatically returned to the app with refreshed subscription status.

### Enhanced Subscription Verification ✅

**Date:** June 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

- ✅ **Created Comprehensive Verification Utility**: Built `packages/shared/utils/subscription-verification.ts` with multi-step verification logic

- ✅ **Dual-Source Verification**: Checks both `user_subscriptions` table and `users.plan_slug` for complete coverage
- ✅ **Edge Case Handling**: Properly handles admin-granted subscriptions, legacy access, and database inconsistencies
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Tested with Neon MCP tools using real subscription data
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Responses**: Provides detailed error messages with verification source and subscription details
- ✅ **Package Exports Updated**: Added subscription verification to shared package exports
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Created and ran test suite validating all verification scenarios
- ✅ **Documentation Created**: Full implementation documentation in `docs/enhanced-subscription-verification.md`
- ✅ **Graceful Error Handling**: Database errors logged but don't block checkout flow
- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: No build errors, full type safety maintained

**Verification Sources:**

- `database_subscription`: Active subscription found in user_subscriptions table
- `user_plan_slug`: VT+ access found in users.plan_slug (admin/legacy)
- `none`: No active subscription found (checkout allowed)

**Test Results:**

- ✅ Users with active subscriptions: BLOCKED with detailed error
- ✅ Users with plan access only: BLOCKED with legacy access message
- ✅ Users without subscriptions: ALLOWED to proceed
- ✅ Database error scenarios: ALLOWED with graceful degradation

**Result:** Enhanced verification prevents duplicate Creem subscriptions by checking both subscription records and plan access, providing comprehensive coverage for all subscription scenarios.
