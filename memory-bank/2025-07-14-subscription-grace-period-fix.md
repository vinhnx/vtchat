# Subscription Grace Period Fix - July 14, 2025

## Issue Report
User reported that subscription ID `1d1cc456-63d0-4fed-833d-a3b7dcf77b62` should show VT+ but displays as base tier.

## Investigation Results
- **Subscription ID doesn't exist** in the database
- Found user `vinhnguyen2308@gmail.com` (ID: `dc60d50d-9aac-47e7-8cb1-ce9000d28208`) with subscription `2b1e04da-fa7d-4086-b0f3-b4ba4de79dd0`
- **Subscription expired**: Mon Jul 14 2025 13:47:35 GMT+0700 (today)
- **Current time**: Mon Jul 14 2025 16:47:08 GMT+0700 (3 hours past expiration)
- **Conclusion**: NOT a bug - subscription legitimately expired

## Critical Issues Found by Oracle
The Oracle identified **two critical issues** in the subscription logic:

### Issue A: Grace Period Not Respected
- Users with status `trialing`, `past_due`, or `canceled` instantly lost VT+ access
- **Should maintain access until `currentPeriodEnd`** regardless of status
- **Problem**: Logic was `isPlusSubscriber = isVtPlus && status === "active"`
- **Fix**: Use centralized `hasSubscriptionAccess()` function

### Issue B: Timezone Comparison Bug
- Time comparison used `new Date() > currentPeriodEnd` (timezone-unsafe)
- Could cause premature expiration around midnight in mixed-timezone setups
- **Fix**: Use epoch milliseconds for timezone-safe comparison

## Files Fixed

### 1. API Route: apps/web/app/api/subscription/status/route.ts
- Added import for `hasSubscriptionAccess` and `getEffectiveAccessStatus`
- Replaced manual expiration check with `getEffectiveAccessStatus()`
- Updated `isPlusSubscriber` calculation to use `hasSubscriptionAccess()`

### 2. Fast Access: apps/web/lib/subscription/fast-subscription-access.ts
- Added imports for grace period utilities
- Updated `isActive` calculation to use `hasSubscriptionAccess()`
- Applied fix to both single and batch subscription lookups

### 3. UI Components
- **apps/web/app/plus/page.tsx**: Removed redundant `status === ACTIVE` check
- **apps/web/app/agent/page.tsx**: Removed redundant `status === ACTIVE` check
- **Simplified logic**: Use `isPlusSubscriber` directly (already includes grace period logic)

### 4. Test Coverage
- **apps/web/app/tests/subscription-grace-period.test.ts**: Added comprehensive tests
- Covers all subscription statuses and grace period scenarios
- Tests both `hasSubscriptionAccess()` and `getEffectiveAccessStatus()` functions

## Impact
- **Users with canceled/past_due subscriptions** now retain access until `currentPeriodEnd`
- **Timezone-safe** expiration checking prevents premature access loss
- **Consistent logic** across all subscription access points
- **UI components** now trust the centralized `isPlusSubscriber` calculation

## Grace Period Behavior
Users retain VT+ access until `currentPeriodEnd` for these statuses:
- `ACTIVE` ✅
- `TRIALING` ✅  
- `CANCELED` ✅ (grace period)
- `PAST_DUE` ✅ (grace period)

No access for:
- `EXPIRED` ❌
- `INACTIVE` ❌
- `INCOMPLETE` ❌

## Test Results
All 13 tests pass, covering:
- Active subscriptions with future/past expiration
- Canceled subscriptions with grace period
- Past due subscriptions with grace period
- Trialing subscriptions
- Expired/inactive subscriptions
- Effective status determination

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor subscription metrics** for any access pattern changes
2. **Update materialized view** `user_subscription_summary` if needed
3. **Cache invalidation** after subscription status changes
4. **Alert on tier mismatches** between API and DB

## Root Cause Summary
The original issue was NOT a bug - the subscription had legitimately expired. However, the investigation revealed and fixed two critical issues that would have caused problems for users in grace period scenarios.
