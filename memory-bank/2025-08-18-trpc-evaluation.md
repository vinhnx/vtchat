# tRPC Integration Evaluation

- Reviewed tRPC repository to understand features and compatibility
- tRPC could offer end-to-end type safety for API calls and simplify client-server communication
- Integration would require wrapping tRPC fetch usage to align with project's `http` client policy
- No code changes were made; analysis only
- Next step: Decide whether to prototype tRPC router for a small feature
