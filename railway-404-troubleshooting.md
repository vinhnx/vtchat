# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
Getting 404 errors with `x-railway-fallback: true` header, indicating Railway can't find the application.

## Possible Causes and Solutions

### 1. Server.js Path Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Dockerfile was trying to run `apps/web/server.js` instead of `server.js`
- **Solution**: Updated CMD to `["node", "server.js"]`

### 2. Port Binding Issue
- **Problem**: Railway requires dynamic port binding
- **Solution**: Updated CMD to use `PORT=${PORT:-3000} node server.js`

### 3. Railway Domain/Service Configuration
- **Problem**: Domain might not be properly linked to service
- **Check**: Verify Railway project settings

### 4. Next.js Standalone Build Issue
- **Status**: ✅ Confirmed `output: 'standalone'` is set
- **Status**: ✅ Confirmed `outputFileTracingRoot` is configured

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Updated Dockerfile**
   ```bash
   git add Dockerfile
   git commit -m "fix: correct server startup and port binding for Railway"
   git push
   railway up
   ```

2. **Check Railway Logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```
   Look for:
   - Application startup messages
   - Port binding confirmation
   - Any error messages

3. **Verify Railway Service Configuration**
   - Check that domain is properly configured
   - Ensure service is using correct port (3000 or dynamic)
   - Verify deployment is successful

4. **Test Basic Endpoints**
   - `/` - Should redirect to `/chat`
   - `/api/health` - Should return health status
   - `/login` - Should show login page

## Expected Fix
With the corrected server.js path and proper port binding, the application should:
- Start successfully on Railway
- Respond to HTTP requests
- Eliminate the 404 fallback errors
