# Usage Settings Section Implementation

## Summary

Successfully created a dedicated "Usage" settings section with an improved, more positive rate limit usage meter component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Settings Store (`packages/common/store/app.store.ts`)

- Added `USAGE: 'usage'` to the `SETTING_TABS` enum
- This creates a new tab identifier for the usage section

### 2. Updated Settings Modal (`packages/common/components/settings-modal.tsx`)

- Added new "Usage" menu item to `settingMenu` array:
    ```javascript
    {
        title: 'Usage',
        description: 'Track your VT usage and explore upgrade options',
        key: SETTING_TABS.USAGE,
        component: <RateLimitUsageMeter userId={session?.user?.id} />,
    }
    ```
- Removed the rate limit meter from the API Keys section to avoid duplication
- Fixed unused variable issue

### 3. Completely Rewrote Rate Limit Usage Meter (`packages/common/components/rate-limit-usage-meter.tsx`)

#### Key Improvements:

- **Positive Language**: Changed from threatening warnings to encouraging messaging
- **Title**: "Usage Overview" instead of "AI Model Usage"
- **Subtitle**: "Track your VT usage and explore upgrade options"
- **Status Badges**:
    - "Active", "Popular", "Busy" instead of "Normal", "Warning", "Critical"
    - "Available", "Active", "Busy" instead of "Low", "Moderate", "High"
- **Colors**: Uses positive blue/green gradients instead of warning red/orange
- **VT+ Upgrade CTA**: Added prominent upgrade call-to-action when usage is high (≥60% daily or ≥50% per-minute)
    - Features crown icon and benefits list
    - Encouraging copy: "Loving VT? Upgrade to VT+ for More!"
    - Lists benefits: "Higher daily limits", "Priority processing", "Advanced models"

#### Technical Improvements:

- Uses existing `@repo/ui` components instead of custom implementations
- Proper TypeScript types
- Maintains same API integration (no breaking changes)
- Clean, responsive design

#### Messaging Changes:

- **Before**: "Approaching Rate Limits" with warning alerts
- **After**: "You're making great use of VT!" with positive messaging
- **Before**: Focus on limitations and restrictions
- **After**: Focus on achievements and upgrade benefits

## File Structure

```
packages/common/
├── store/
│   └── app.store.ts (added USAGE tab)
├── components/
│   ├── settings-modal.tsx (added Usage section)
│   └── rate-limit-usage-meter.tsx (completely rewritten)
```

## Integration

The new Usage section is now available in the settings modal navigation and provides a dedicated space for:

1. Tracking current usage with positive messaging
2. Showcasing VT+ upgrade benefits
3. Encouraging user engagement rather than limiting behavior

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: More encouraging and less intimidating
2. **Conversion Focused**: Prominently features upgrade path
3. **Organized**: Dedicated section separate from API management
4. **Maintainable**: Uses existing UI components and patterns
5. **Non-Breaking**: Same API, just improved presentation
