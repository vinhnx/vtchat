# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## üîß Current Configuration Status

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Railway detecting Dockerfile instead of Nixpacks

- **Problem**: Railway was showing "Using Detected Dockerfile" in build logs
- **Root Cause**: Railway prioritizes Dockerfile over Nixpacks when both are present
- **Solution**:
  1. Removed all Dockerfile files from project root
  2. Configured `railway.toml` to explicitly use `builder = "NIXPACKS"`
  3. Updated `nixpacks.toml` with explicit Bun provider configuration

### ‚úÖ FIXED: npm ci Issue (Bun Provider Detection)

- **Problem**: Railway Nixpacks was detecting project as npm and running `npm ci`
- **Solution**: Configured `.nixpacks` file to force Bun provider and updated configuration files

### ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUE: Nixpacks "/app" Directory Conflict

- **Problem**: Nixpacks uses `/app` as its internal working directory, but Next.js projects have an `app/` folder
- **Error**: `Error: Writing app - Caused by: Is a directory (os error 21)`
- **Root Cause**: Nixpacks cannot create `/app` because it conflicts with the Next.js `app/` directory
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. ‚úó Temporary directory renaming during build phases
  2. ‚úó Using `onlyIncludeFiles` to exclude app directory
  3. ‚úó Alternative working directory configuration
  4. ‚úó Custom Dockerfile approach
  5. ‚úó Minimal Nixpacks configuration

### Known Working Solutions

According to Railway community and research:

1. **Use Custom Dockerfile** (most reliable)
   - Railway supports Dockerfiles and will use them instead of Nixpacks
   - Avoids the `/app` directory conflict entirely
   - Allows full control over build process

2. **Move Next.js app directory** (requires code changes)
   - Rename `apps/web/app` to `apps/web/src/app`
   - Update Next.js configuration to use new structure
   - Not ideal as it requires significant project restructuring

3. **Use different build strategy**
   - Some projects successfully use Vercel or Netlify for similar monorepos
   - Consider alternative deployment platforms

### Files Configured

- ‚úÖ `railway.toml` - Build and deploy commands with explicit Nixpacks builder
- ‚úÖ `nixpacks.toml` - Minimal configuration to force Node provider
- ‚úÖ `.nixpacks` - Force Node provider detection (bun auto-detected)
- ‚úÖ `.bunfig.toml` - Bun configuration
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- ‚úÖ No Dockerfile present (removed to force Nixpacks)

## üöÄ Current Deployment Status

**PROGRESS**: Implementing Docker-based deployment to bypass Nixpacks `/app` directory conflict

Current approach:

- ‚úÖ **Dockerfile Strategy**: Created multi-stage Dockerfile using Bun 1.1.19 Alpine
- ‚úÖ **Railway Configuration**: Updated `railway.toml` to use `DOCKERFILE` builder
- ‚úÖ **Lock File Fix**: Corrected Dockerfile to use `bun.lock` instead of `bun.lockb`
- üîÑ **Build In Progress**: Currently deploying with Docker approach
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Local Build Issues**: React error in static generation (may not affect Railway build)

**Recent Changes**:

- Switched from Nixpacks to Dockerfile due to `/app` directory conflict
- Fixed Drizzle ORM version conflict with temporary workaround
- Updated Next.js config to move `outputFileTracingRoot` to root level
- Created optimized multi-stage Docker build for Railway

**Next Steps**:

1. Monitor current Docker-based deployment
2. If successful, verify health check endpoint
3. Test application functionality
4. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
5. Document successful configuration for future deployments

## üîÑ **CURRENT DEPLOYMENT ITERATION:**

**Docker Build Progress**:

- ‚úÖ **Package Installation Fix**: Resolved Alpine Linux `libc6-compat` conflict
- üîÑ **Dependency Installation**: Build progressing through `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issue**: Large dependency tree may cause timeouts

**Build Logs Observations**:

```
[5/6] RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun install v1.1.19 (11084935)
[16.45ms] migrated lockfile from package-lock.json
Resolving dependencies
Deploy failed
```

**Current Status**: Build failing during dependency resolution - investigating timeout/memory issues

## üìä Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs --tail

# Get service URL
railway domain

# Check variables
railway variables
```

## üîß Environment Variables Needed

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."  # Auto-generated
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://your-app.up.railway.app"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
CREEM_API_KEY="your-key"
CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-secret"
CREEM_PRODUCT_ID="your-product-id"
CREEM_ENVIRONMENT="sandbox"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### 1. Railway Detects Dockerfile Instead of Nixpacks

**Symptoms**: Build logs show "Using Detected Dockerfile" instead of Nixpacks
**Fix**:

```bash
# Remove any Dockerfile from project root
rm -f Dockerfile*

# Verify no Dockerfile exists
find . -name "Dockerfile*" -type f

# Force Nixpacks in railway.toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
nixpacksConfigPath = "nixpacks.toml"
```

### 2. Build Fails with npm ci

- **Fixed**: Force Bun provider with `.nixpacks` file
- **Config**: `{"providers": ["bun"]}`

### 2. Dependencies Not Found

- **Check**: `bun.lockb` exists and is committed
- **Fix**: Run `bun install` locally and commit lockfile

### 3. Build Times Out

- **Cause**: Large dependency installation
- **Fix**: Optimize dependencies, remove unused packages

### 4. Runtime Errors

- **Check**: Environment variables are set
- **Check**: Database connection string is correct
- **Check**: Health check endpoint responds

## üéØ Success Indicators

‚úÖ Upload completes successfully
‚úÖ Build logs show "Using Detected Bun"
‚úÖ Dependencies install with Bun
‚úÖ Build completes without errors
‚úÖ Service starts on port 3000
‚úÖ Health check returns 200

## üìû Next Steps

1. Monitor build progress in Railway dashboard
2. Check build logs for any errors
3. Set environment variables once deployed
4. Test the health check endpoint
5. Update `BETTER_AUTH_URL` with actual domain
