# Thread Isolation & Per-Account Privacy Features

## Overview

VT implements advanced per-account data isolation to ensure maximum privacy and security for all users. This documentation explains how the thread isolation system works and why threads "disappear" when switching accounts.

## Core Architecture

### Per-Account Database Isolation

VT uses a unique database-per-user architecture:

```
Anonymous User     → ThreadDatabase_anonymous
User Account A     → ThreadDatabase_userA
User Account B     → ThreadDatabase_userB
```

**Key Benefits:**

- ✅ **Complete Privacy**: Zero cross-user data access
- ✅ **Security**: No data leakage between accounts
- ✅ **Multi-User Safety**: Safe for shared devices
- ✅ **Local Storage**: Everything stays on your device

### What Gets Isolated

1. **Threads & Conversations**
    - Each user gets their own IndexedDB database
    - Threads are completely isolated per account
    - Anonymous and authenticated users have separate storage

2. **API Keys (BYOK)**
    - Stored in user-specific localStorage keys
    - Format: `api-keys-storage-{userId}`
    - Automatically cleared on logout for security

3. **MCP Tool Configurations**
    - Per-user MCP tool settings
    - Format: `mcp-tools-storage-{userId}`
    - Isolated configuration per account

4. **User Preferences**
    - Chat settings and preferences per user
    - Theme settings (VT+ Dark Theme)
    - Model configurations

## Expected Behavior

### Account Switching

When you switch from anonymous to authenticated (or between accounts):

```
Before: Anonymous user with 5 threads
After:  Logged-in user with 0 threads (fresh start)
```

**This is NOT a bug** - it's intentional security behavior:

- Anonymous threads stay in `ThreadDatabase_anonymous`
- Your new account starts with `ThreadDatabase_{userId}`
- Previous threads are safely stored but hidden
- Switching back reveals original threads

### Console Logs (Normal Behavior)

```
[ThreadAuth] User changed from anonymous to x9UOfXF0I2Bqifg4ge7bbapb6osrDeUv
[ThreadDB] Switching to database for user: x9UOfXF0I2Bqifg4ge7bbapb6osrDeUv
[ThreadDB] Successfully switched to user database with 0 threads
```

This confirms:

1. ✅ User authentication change detected
2. ✅ Database successfully switched
3. ✅ New user starts fresh (correct behavior)

## Implementation Details

### Database Switching (`useThreadAuth`)

The `useThreadAuth` hook automatically manages database switching:

```typescript
// Triggered on authentication change
useEffect(() => {
    const currentUserId = session?.user?.id || null;

    if (currentUserId !== previousUserId) {
        // Switch to user-specific database
        switchUserDatabase(currentUserId);
        switchUserStorage(currentUserId);
        switchMcpUserStorage(currentUserId);
    }
}, [session?.user?.id]);
```

### Secure Logout (`useLogout`)

Logout performs comprehensive security cleanup:

```typescript
const logout = async () => {
    // 1. Reset theme (clears VT+ Dark Theme)
    setTheme('light');

    // 2. Clear all API keys (BYOK security)
    clearAllKeys();

    // 3. Clear MCP configurations
    setMcpConfig({});

    // 4. Clear all threads
    await clearAllThreads();

    // 5. Clear subscription cache
    // 6. Sign out from authentication
    await signOut();
};
```

### Storage Safety Features

1. **Corrupted Data Cleanup**
    - Automatic detection and removal of corrupted localStorage
    - Safe JSON parsing with fallbacks
    - Periodic cleanup every 5 minutes

2. **SSR Safety**
    - Database operations only on client-side
    - Proper guards for server-side rendering
    - No "db is null" errors

3. **Runtime Error Prevention**
    - All localStorage operations wrapped in try/catch
    - Safe JSON parsing utilities
    - Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Security Benefits

### Privacy Protection

- **Local-Only Storage**: All conversations stay on your device
- **Zero Server Access**: We never see your chat history
- **Per-Account Encryption**: API keys encrypted per user
- **Cross-User Isolation**: No data mixing between accounts

### Multi-User Safety

Perfect for:

- Shared computers
- Family devices
- Work environments
- Public computers

Each user gets completely isolated storage with no cross-contamination.

### BYOK Security

- API keys stored only in your browser
- Encrypted local storage
- Automatic clearing on logout
- Per-user isolation prevents key mixing

## Troubleshooting

### "My threads disappeared!"

**Diagnosis**: You switched accounts or logged in/out.

**Solution**: This is expected behavior for security.

**Options**:

1. Switch back to previous account to see those threads
2. Stay in current account and start fresh
3. Export/import threads manually (future feature)

### Console Warnings

Common safe warnings:

```
[StorageCleanup] Cleaned up 4 corrupted storage entries
[ThreadDB] Successfully switched to user database with 0 threads
```

These indicate the system is working correctly and cleaning up corrupted data.

### Performance Issues

If you experience slow switching:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh the page
3. Check for browser console errors

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Thread Migration Tool**
    - Export anonymous threads
    - Import to authenticated account
    - User-controlled migration

2. **Cross-Device Sync** (Optional)
    - Server-side thread backup
    - Multi-device synchronization
    - Encrypted cloud storage

3. **Export/Import**
    - JSON export of conversation history
    - Selective thread backup
    - Account migration tools

### Current Limitations

- No automatic thread migration between accounts
- No cross-device synchronization
- Manual recreation needed for important conversations

### Database Schema

```typescript
class ThreadDatabase extends Dexie {
    threads!: Table<Thread>;
    threadItems!: Table<ThreadItem>;

    constructor(userId?: string) {
        // Per-user database naming
        const dbName = userId ? `ThreadDatabase_${userId}` : 'ThreadDatabase_anonymous';
        super(dbName);
    }
}
```

### Storage Keys

```typescript
// Per-user storage patterns
const STORAGE_PATTERNS = {
    threads: `ThreadDatabase_${userId}`,
    apiKeys: `api-keys-storage-${userId}`,
    mcpTools: `mcp-tools-storage-${userId}`,
    config: `chat-config-${userId}`,
};
```

## Status: Production Ready ✅

All per-account isolation features are fully implemented and tested:

- ✅ Thread isolation working correctly
- ✅ API key per-user storage functional
- ✅ MCP tool isolation implemented
- ✅ Secure logout process complete
- ✅ Runtime error prevention active
- ✅ Storage corruption handling operational

**Summary**: The thread isolation system is working exactly as designed for maximum privacy and security.
