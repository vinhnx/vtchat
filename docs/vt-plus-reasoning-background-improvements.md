# VT+ Reasoning Mode Background Improvements

## Overview
Improved the background styling for VT+ reasoning mode cards in settings to use lighter, more modern colors instead of dark backgrounds.

## Changes Made

### 1. ReasoningModeSettings Component
**File**: `packages/common/components/reasoning-mode-settings.tsx`

#### Before:
- Dark background gradients: `from-[#262626] to-[#262626]/95`
- Heavy, dark appearance that didn't match modern UI trends

#### After:
- Light, translucent backgrounds: `from-white/5 via-[#D99A4E]/5 to-[#BFB38F]/5`
- Added `backdrop-blur-sm` for modern glass-morphism effect
- Icon containers now use: `from-[#D99A4E]/10 to-[#BFB38F]/10 border border-[#D99A4E]/20`

### 2. ThinkingModeIndicator Component
**File**: `packages/common/components/chat-input/thinking-mode-indicator.tsx`

#### Before:
- Dark badge background: `from-[#262626] to-[#262626]/95`

#### After:
- Light badge background: `from-[#D99A4E]/10 to-[#BFB38F]/10`
- Added `backdrop-blur-sm` for consistency

## Design Principles

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: `#D99A4E` (Gold) - 10% opacity for backgrounds
- **Secondary**: `#BFB38F` (Beige) - 10% opacity for backgrounds
- **Accent**: White - 5% opacity for subtle highlights

### Visual Effects
- **Backdrop Blur**: Added `backdrop-blur-sm` for modern glass-morphism
- **Gradients**: Subtle multi-stop gradients for depth
- **Transparency**: Low opacity overlays for elegance

### Accessibility
- Maintained color contrast ratios
- Preserved text readability
- Kept interactive elements clearly identifiable

## Components Affected

1. **VT+ Upgrade Card** (for free users)
   - Header icon container
   - Main card background
   - Button styling (unchanged - maintains good contrast)

2. **Settings Cards** (for VT+ users)
   - "Enable Reasoning Mode" card
   - "Show Reasoning Details" card
   - "Reasoning Budget" card
   - Header icon container

3. **Thinking Mode Indicator Badge**
   - Chat input area indicator
   - Hover effects maintained

## Testing

Created test file: `apps/web/app/tests/reasoning-mode-bg-improvement.test.tsx`

- Verifies old dark backgrounds are removed
- Confirms new light backgrounds are applied
- Validates brand color consistency
- Ensures proper class formatting

## Benefits
