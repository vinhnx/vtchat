# Gemini Nano Banana - Conversational Image Editing

**New to VT Chat** - The Conversational image editor powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.

## Overview

Nano Banana transforms traditional image editing from a technical process into an intuitive conversation. Generate an image, then iteratively refine it through natural language without losing previous modifications or starting over.

## Key Features

### üåü What Makes Nano Banana Unique

- **Conversational Context**: Maintains full conversation history for iterative edits

- **Preservation of Changes**: Each edit builds on previous modifications
- **Visual History**: See the evolution of your image through the conversation
- **Instant Results**: Real-time image generation and editing

### üé® How It Works

1. **Start a Conversation**: Generate your initial image with a simple prompt
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Make changes through natural language
   - "Make the cat bigger"
   - "Change the background to a sunset"
   - "Add a party hat"
   - "Make the person smile more"
3. **Context Preservation**: Each edit remembers all previous changes
4. **Visual Timeline**: Track your image's evolution in the chat history
