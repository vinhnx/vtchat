# Subscription Store Removal - Completed

## Summary

The legacy Zustand subscription store has been completely removed and replaced with the global SubscriptionProvider. All subscription state management now flows through a single, robust, and deduplicated source of truth.

## What Was Removed

- ✅ **`/packages/common/store/subscription.store.ts`** - Deleted entirely
- ✅ **Exports from store/index.ts** - Removed and updated with note
- ✅ **Exports from subscription/index.ts** - Removed deprecated store hooks exports
- ✅ **Import in subscription/provider.tsx** - Removed and disabled functionality
- ✅ **Legacy hook usage** - Fixed `useCurrentPlan` and `useCreemSubscription` API inconsistencies

## What Is Now Used Instead

All subscription logic now uses the **SubscriptionProvider** from `@repo/common/providers/subscription-provider` which provides:

- **Deduplication**: Only one API call per session/account
- **Cache invalidation**: Real-time updates on payment callbacks
- **Global state**: Shared across all components
- **Performance**: Session-cached API endpoints
- **Reliability**: Proper sync with Neon DB and Creem.io webhooks

## Migration Complete

- All components now use `useGlobalSubscriptionStatus()`
- All feature gating uses the unified subscription system
- Cache invalidation works correctly via webhook
- Build passes TypeScript compilation (✅)
