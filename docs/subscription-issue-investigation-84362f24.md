# VT+ Subscription Issue Investigation Report

## Issue Summary

**User ID:** `84362f24-8643-4a1e-8615-bb605c3e7717`
**Email:** `kiweuro@gmail.com`
**Problem:** User subscribed to VT+ tier but application still displays as BASE user

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Database Status: CORRECT

The production database shows the user's subscription is correctly configured:

```sql
-- Users table
users.plan_slug = "vt_plus" ✅
users.creem_customer_id = "cust_6Fs8w8L0NmyIe0KOQHvSco" ✅

-- User subscriptions table
user_subscriptions.plan = "vt_plus" ✅
user_subscriptions.status = "active" ✅
user_subscriptions.current_period_start = "2025-07-05T06:19:01.797Z" ✅
user_subscriptions.current_period_end = "2025-08-04T06:19:01.797Z" ✅
user_subscriptions.creem_subscription_id = "sub_10nEr9UoZpG2fp0anFo2ek" ✅
```

**Subscription is valid until August 4, 2025** - 30 days remaining.

### ❌ Frontend Issue: SESSION/CACHE PROBLEM

When testing the subscription status API endpoint, the response shows:

```json
{
    "plan": "vt_base",
    "status": "active",
    "isPlusSubscriber": false,
    "isAnonymous": true
}
```

This indicates the user is not properly authenticated in their current session.

## Root Cause Analysis

The subscription data in the database is 100% correct. The issue is on the frontend where:

1. **Session Authentication Issue:** The user's session may be corrupted or expired
2. **Cache Invalidation Needed:** The frontend cache is showing stale data
3. **Browser State Problem:** Browser storage may have outdated subscription status

## Solution Steps

### For the User (Immediate Fix)

1. **Complete Logout and Clear Cache**

    - Log out completely from https://vtchat.io.vn
    - Clear browser cache and cookies for vtchat.io.vn
    - Close all browser tabs/windows for the site

2. **Fresh Login**

    - Go to https://vtchat.io.vn
    - Log in with the same account (kiweuro@gmail.com)
    - The VT+ status should now display correctly

3. **Verify VT+ Features**
    - Check that the user badge shows "VT+"
    - Verify access to VT+ exclusive features:
        - Enhanced Web Search (Pro Search)
        - Deep Research
        - Personal AI Assistant with Memory (RAG)

### For Development Team (Backend Fix)

If the above doesn't work, there may be a session synchronization issue. The webhook system correctly updated the database when the user subscribed, but the frontend cache wasn't invalidated.

### API Endpoints for Cache Management

The system has these endpoints for cache management:

- `/api/subscription/invalidate-cache` - Invalidates user subscription cache
- `/api/subscription/status?force=true` - Forces fresh data fetch

## Verification Query

To verify the fix worked, run this query after the user reports success:

```sql
SELECT
  u.email,
  u.plan_slug,
  us.plan as subscription_plan,
  us.status as subscription_status,
  us.current_period_end
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_subscriptions us ON u.id = us.user_id
WHERE u.id = '84362f24-8643-4a1e-8615-bb605c3e7717';
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Enhanced Webhook Processing:** Ensure webhooks properly invalidate frontend caches
2. **Session Synchronization:** Improve real-time subscription status updates
3. **Cache Strategy:** Review cache invalidation patterns for subscription changes

## Status: READY TO RESOLVE

The user should follow the logout/clear cache/login steps above. The database is correct and no backend changes are needed. This is a frontend session issue that will be resolved by clearing the user's browser state.
