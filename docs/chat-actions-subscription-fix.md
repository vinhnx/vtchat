# Chat Actions Subscription Integration Fix

## Overview

Updated `packages/common/components/chat-input/chat-actions.tsx` to properly integrate with the unified subscription system for accurate gated feature handling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Improper Gated Feature Detection**

- **Before**: Only checked for existence of `requiredFeature` or `requiredPlan` in config
- **After**: Uses unified subscription system to verify actual user access

### 2. **Missing Subscription Status Validation**

- **Before**: Showed upgrade prompts even for users who already had VT+ access
- **After**: Properly validates subscription status before blocking access

### 3. **Inconsistent Gating Logic**

- **Before**: Different components used different logic for determining gated status
- **After**: Unified logic using `hasAccess()` from global subscription provider

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Imports**

```tsx
// Added PlanSlug import
import { FeatureSlug, PlanSlug } from '@repo/shared/types/subscription';
```

### 2. **Enhanced ChatModeOptions Component**

- Added `useSubscriptionAccess()` hook integration
- Updated `handleModeSelect()` to use actual subscription validation:

  ```tsx
  // Check feature access
  if (config.requiredFeature) {
      hasRequiredAccess = hasAccess({ feature: config.requiredFeature as FeatureSlug });
  }

  // Check plan access
  if (config.requiredPlan && hasRequiredAccess) {
      hasRequiredAccess = hasAccess({ plan: config.requiredPlan as PlanSlug });
  }
  ```

### 3. **Added Helper Function**

- Created `isModeGated()` helper function for consistent gating logic:

  ```tsx
  const isModeGated = (mode: ChatMode): boolean => {
      if (!isLoaded) return false; // Don't show as gated while loading

      const config = ChatModeConfig[mode];
      if (!config?.requiredFeature && !config?.requiredPlan) {
          return false; // Not gated if no requirements
      }

      let hasRequiredAccess = true;

      if (config.requiredFeature) {
          hasRequiredAccess = hasAccess({ feature: config.requiredFeature as FeatureSlug });
      }

      if (config.requiredPlan && hasRequiredAccess) {
          hasRequiredAccess = hasAccess({ plan: config.requiredPlan as PlanSlug });
      }

      return !hasRequiredAccess;
  };
  ```

### 4. **Enhanced ChatModeButton Component**

- Updated current mode gating detection to use unified subscription system
- Replaced simple config check with actual subscription validation
- Added loading state handling to prevent incorrect gating display

## Benefits

### 1. **Accurate Access Control**

- ✅ VT+ subscribers can now access premium features without seeing upgrade prompts
- ✅ Free users see appropriate gating for premium features
- ✅ Anonymous users get proper login prompts

### 2. **Consistent User Experience**

- ✅ Gated feature detection matches actual subscription access
- ✅ UI correctly reflects user's subscription status
- ✅ No false positives for upgrade prompts

### 3. **Real-time Updates**

- ✅ Subscription status changes are reflected immediately
- ✅ Payment completions unlock features instantly
- ✅ Expired subscriptions properly restrict access

### 4. **Better Performance**

- ✅ Uses global subscription provider (single API call)
- ✅ Cached subscription status across components
- ✅ Efficient loading state handling

## Testing Scenarios

### VT+ Subscribers

- ✅ Should be able to select premium models without upgrade prompts
- ✅ Should see all advanced features as available
- ✅ Should not see "(VT+)" labels as blocking

### Free Users

- ✅ Should see "(VT+)" labels on premium features
- ✅ Should get upgrade prompts when selecting premium models
- ✅ Should be redirected to upgrade page

### Anonymous Users

- ✅ Should see login prompts for any model selection
- ✅ Should be redirected to login page
- ✅ Should see all features as available after login (based on subscription)

## Integration with Subscription System

This component now properly integrates with:

- ✅ Global SubscriptionProvider for state management
- ✅ Session-based caching for performance
- ✅ Real-time webhook updates from Creem.io
- ✅ Neon DB subscription status synchronization

## Code Quality

- ✅ Type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Efficient re-rendering with proper React hooks usage

The chat actions component now provides accurate, real-time subscription-based access control that properly integrates with the unified subscription system.
