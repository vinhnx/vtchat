## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure for Railway

Your project structure is optimized for Railway deployment:

```
vtchat/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile                 # ‚úÖ Railway deployment config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ railway.toml              # ‚úÖ Railway service configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.railway             # ‚úÖ Environment variables template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/web/                # Next.js application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/                # Shared packages
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                    # Documentation
```

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Development vs Production Environments

#### Option 1: Single Environment (Recommended for MVP)

- Use one Railway service for production
- Test locally with `.env.local`

#### Option 2: Multiple Environments

- **Development**: `vtchat-dev` Railway project
- **Production**: `vtchat-prod` Railway project

### Setting Up Environment Variables

#### 1. Critical Variables (Required for app to work)

```bash
# Authentication (MUST HAVE)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=generate-32-char-secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
BETTER_AUTH_ENV=production

# Database (MUST HAVE)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require

# Application Base
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
BASE_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

#### 2. AI Service Keys (For chat functionality)

```bash
# All models are BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-anthropic-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your-fireworks-key
```

#### 3. Social Authentication (Optional)

```bash
# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

#### 4. Payment Integration (Optional)

```bash
# Creem.io for subscriptions
CREEM_API_KEY=your-creem-api-key
CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-creem-webhook-secret
CREEM_PRODUCT_ID=your-product-id
```

#### 5. Additional Services (Optional)

```bash
# Redis for caching
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-redis-url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-token

# Email service
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-key

# Search/embeddings
JINA_API_KEY=your-jina-key
```

### Environment Variables Setup Methods

#### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Service
2. Click **Variables** tab
3. Add variables one by one
4. Click **Deploy** after adding all variables

#### Method 2: Railway CLI

```bash
# Set single variable
railway variables --set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret

# Set multiple variables from file
railway variables --set --file .env.railway
```

#### Method 3: Bulk Import

Create `.env.railway` locally (DO NOT COMMIT), then:

```bash
railway variables --set $(cat .env.railway | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Secret Generation

```bash
# Generate secure secrets
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Or use Railway's secret generation
railway variables --set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

### Environment Variable Security

1. **Never commit** `.env` files with real values
2. **Use Railway's encrypted storage** for secrets
3. **Rotate secrets** regularly
4. **Use different secrets** for development/production
5. **Audit access** regularly

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Option 1: Railway PostgreSQL (Recommended)

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL service to your Railway project
railway add postgresql

# Get database URL
railway variables get DATABASE_URL
```

### Option 2: Neon PostgreSQL (Alternative)

1. Create database at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Copy connection string
3. Set in Railway: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`

### Database Migration

```bash
# Run migrations on deployment
# This is handled automatically by your Next.js build process
# Database migrations are in: apps/web/migration_better_auth.sql
```

## üö¢ Deployment Configuration

### railway.toml Optimization

```toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

# Optional: Custom domains
# [environments.production.domains]
# custom = ["yourdomain.com"]
```

### Dockerfile Best Practices

Your current Dockerfile is optimized for:

- ‚úÖ **Bun for package management** (faster installs)
- ‚úÖ **npm for builds** (better compatibility)
- ‚úÖ **Alpine Linux** (smaller image size)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-stage builds** (optimized layers)
- ‚úÖ **Non-root user** (security)

### Build Performance Tips

1. **Layer caching**: Dependencies installed before code copy
2. **Ignore files**: Use `.dockerignore`
3. **Minimize rebuilds**: Only copy necessary files
4. **Health checks**: Ensure app is ready before traffic

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup

1. **Copy environment template**:

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```

2. **Fill in local values**:

   ```bash
   # Development values
   BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   BETTER_AUTH_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=your-local-or-dev-db
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

### Testing Production Builds Locally

```bash
# Build production version
bun run build

# Test production build locally
bun start

# Or test with Docker (exactly like Railway)
docker build -t vtchat .
docker run -p 3000:3000 vtchat
```

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Make changes** in your local environment
2. **Test locally** with `bun dev`
3. **Commit & push** to your repository
4. **Railway auto-deploys** from your main branch
5. **Monitor deployment** in Railway dashboard
6. **Test production** at your Railway URL

## üéõÔ∏è Multiple Environment Setup

### Development Environment

```bash
# Create development project
railway login
railway init vtchat-dev

# Set development variables
BETTER_AUTH_ENV=development
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://vtchat-dev.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Create production project
railway init vtchat-prod

# Set production variables
BETTER_AUTH_ENV=production
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://vtchat-prod.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Branch-based Deployment

```toml
# railway.toml
[environments.development]
branch = "development"
variables = { NODE_ENV = "development" }

[environments.production]
branch = "main"
variables = { NODE_ENV = "production" }
```

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

Your app includes a health check endpoint:

- **URL**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health`
- **Response**: `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Used by**: Railway health checks

### Logs & Debugging

```bash
# View live logs
railway logs

# View specific service logs
railway logs --service web

# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs --follow
```

### Performance Monitoring

1. **Railway metrics**: Built-in CPU, memory, network usage
2. **Application logs**: Check for errors in Railway dashboard
3. **Health checks**: Monitor endpoint availability
4. **User feedback**: Monitor authentication and chat functionality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Issue: Native dependencies fail
# Solution: Use --ignore-scripts flag (already in Dockerfile)

# Issue: Memory errors during build
# Solution: Increase build resources in Railway settings
```

#### Runtime Issues

```bash
# Issue: Authentication not working
# Check: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET and BETTER_AUTH_URL are set

# Issue: Database connection fails
# Check: DATABASE_URL format and network access

# Issue: AI chat not working
# Check: API keys are set and valid
```

#### Environment Variable Issues

```bash
# Issue: Variables not updating
# Solution: Redeploy after setting variables

# Issue: Variables with special characters
# Solution: Wrap in quotes: VARIABLE="value with spaces"
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check current variables
railway variables list

# Check deployment status
railway status

# Force redeploy
railway up --detach
```

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Railway Pricing Considerations

1. **Starter Plan**: $5/month - suitable for development
2. **Usage-based**: Pay for actual resource consumption
3. **Sleep mode**: Apps sleep after inactivity (saves costs)
4. **Resource limits**: Set appropriate CPU/memory limits

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Use sleep mode** for development environments
2. **Optimize Docker image** size (already done)
3. **Monitor resource usage** in Railway dashboard
4. **Use appropriate instance sizes**
5. **Clean up** unused environments
