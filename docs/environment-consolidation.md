# Environment Variables Consolidation

## Summary

Successfully consolidated multiple environment files into a single source of truth for local development.

## Changes Made

### Files Removed

- ✅ `/vtchat/.env.local` (was empty)
- ✅ `/vtchat/apps/web/.env` (redundant with .env.local)

### Files Kept

- ✅ `/vtchat/apps/web/.env.local` - **Single source of truth for local development**
- ✅ `/vtchat/apps/web/.env.example` - Updated template
- ✅ `/vtchat/.env` - Production template (kept for Railway deployment)
- ✅ `/vtchat/.env.railway` - Railway-specific configuration
- ✅ `/vtchat/packages/ai/.env.example` - AI package template

### Backups Created

All original files backed up with `.backup` extension:

- `.env.local.backup`
- `.env.backup`
- `apps/web/.env.local.backup`
- `apps/web/.env.backup`

## Current Environment Setup

### For Local Development

- **Primary file**: `apps/web/.env.local`
- Contains all necessary environment variables for local development
- Includes development database, test payment keys, local URLs

### For Production/Railway

- **Primary file**: `.env` (root level)
- Used by Railway deployment
- Contains production database, live payment keys, production URLs

## Environment Variables Included

### Authentication

- Better-Auth configuration with local URLs
- GitHub and Google OAuth credentials
- Better-Auth secret for JWT signing

### Database

- Neon PostgreSQL connection (development database)
- Neon project ID and API key

### Redis/Cache

- Upstash Redis configuration for session and credit storage
- Multiple format support (KV_URL, REDIS_URL, UPSTASH_*)

### Payment Processing

- Creem.io sandbox configuration for development
- Test API keys and webhook secrets

### Application Configuration

- Product settings (VT+, pricing)
- Rate limiting (10 requests/day for free tier)
- Logging level (info)

## Next Steps

1. **Verify the setup** by running the development server:

   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   bun dev
   ```

2. **Check environment loading** by visiting `/api/debug` to see which environment variables are loaded

3. **Update any scripts** that might reference the old environment file locations

4. **Team setup**: Other developers should copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env.local` and fill in their values

## Important Notes

- ✅ Only one `.env.local` file now exists in `apps/web/`
- ✅ All environment variables consolidated and organized
- ✅ Removed duplicate/conflicting configurations
- ✅ Maintained proper Next.js environment loading hierarchy
- ✅ Production and development environments clearly separated
